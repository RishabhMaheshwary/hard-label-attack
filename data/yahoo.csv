if u try to fail and succeedwhat have u done ?  can vegetarians eat animal crackers ?  why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections ?  First question simply put you have succeeded at failing .  It would still be a failure to those around you but you could silently applaud yourself for a job well failed .  Second I know a vegetarian that wont eat them just because they are called animal crackers her sister is a vegan and wont eat them because most are made with egg or milk product .  I would look at the ingredients and if they have animal byproducts that you wont eat then dont buy em .. Unless thier for me ...  because I will bite all thier little heads off and then eat a steak ...  Now this third one is a little different .  You ask why they would sterilize them and I asked my mother who is a nurse what she thought about it ..  She simply put me in this situation .   If your about to give lethal drugs to someone and lets say you used a dirty needle .  I said yeah ... so And what happens if you slip and the needle goes into your arm ?  I said It would never happen but yeah good point .  So I would have to say that if you are using a needle even if its not for your arm ...  you wouldnt want to be on the wrong end of something that isnt sterilized .  Trust me its not for the safety of the inmate about to be put down ....  Its for the safety of the nurse givin the shot . Hope this clarifies anything your still asking yourself .  Thanks for letting me respond .  ,3

Would changing my first name affect major parts of my life ?  I want to change my first name from Corie to Corianne .   Its more feminine and professional .   But my parents think if I change my name it will affect my credit college transcripts etc .   They said it would be hard in the future to get a job or a loan because changing your first name makes you look suspicious .   Is this true ?   I really want to go through with it but not if its going to be a huge hassle .  LOL I changed my whole name once completely different .  I even eliminated my middle name entirely .  All it takes here in my county is 75 . 00 and an appearance in a small claims court .  You answer a few questions such as why you are changing your name if you are doing so to evade creditors which the answer has to be no etc .  After the judge grants you the change you have to send in for a change on your birth certificate social security card and whatever else .  It is really easy and for such a small change as yours it will be even easier .  Very few applications ask whether you have ever gone by another name .  I work in healthcare so I had to disclose my other name once but that was it .  You know what ?  I changed my name back a year later .  I just decided to go back to my original name and it was even easier than the first change .  Hopefully it is the same in your area but laws do sometimes differ .  ,9

Starting a GSA in my high school ...?  I would love to start a GayStraight Alliance at my school but I need a teacher sponsor and I just dont know where I could begin to ask .   Also I am out to all my friends but none of my family and do you think this is a worthwhile endeavor considering that I know now is not the time to tell them gearing up for senior year is stressful enough ...  I know if not now when but I will I just dont want to rush it ?   Would it even be worth the trouble ?  I would check out what they have on the GLSEN website they have a whole student section with stuff about how to start a GSA be helpful .  As for asking teachers I would try to find the most liberal one you can think of .   I would look for a teacher who is 1 under 35 2 teachers something not math computers or science look at music psych social studies librarians or sex ed teaches  3 if you cant think of someone talk to your principal or vice principal whomever is in charge of student activities and ask for suggstions 4 and just scew up your courage and ask .   Pitch it as you want to form this club to combat bullying and antigay harassment and give support to fellow gay students as well as build bridges between gay and straight people .   Yes someone might turn you down .   Yes they might get all uncomfortable and weird and turn you down .   But you know what thats life kiddo .   People are going to turn you down people are going to treat you like a freak because you are gay some people are going to be down right bitchy about it .   But that is exactly why you need a GSA  because it is rough to be gay .   If you cave now youll spend the rest of your life feeling like a dumbshit for not just going through with it .   Some rejection from a teacher who you will never see again after graduation is not going to ruin your life .   And you shouldnt be embarassed becuase some people are phobes .   If some teacher turns you down they are the ones who should be embarassed  and you should make them feel as such . If they turn you down just lay on the old guilt .   Say that youre sorry that they are not more willing to be accepting and supporting of diversity in the student body and say that you are really disapointed that you will not be getting their support because it is so necessary for teachers to take a stand and lend authority to antibullying efforts .   Youve got nothing to feel bad about because some people are cowards freaks and phobes .  ,0

why do you men cheating when you already know you have something good ?  There are two or three kinds of cheaters .  The worst kind and I know several are the immature selfish type who seem to need to prove to themselves over and over that they still have it or somehting like that .  Then there is the guy who loses it once or twice .  Men who travel a lot and women get very lonely at night .  Hard to describe but Ive been there .  The porn industry makes a killing by selling all kinds of adult programs to hotel travellers .  They really miss home  ...  the wrong situation the wrong time perhaps there was an angry exchange with the wife  ...  some hot babe walks into the bar and sits next to him  ...  it happens .  The third kind is the guy or woman who has been in a loveless marriage for years .  There is a nice house kids community life and all kinds of great things that came from the marriage .  But somewhere along the way the romance died .  Husbands and wives spend so much time battling over emotional territory work so hard to get what they want out of the marriage  ...  lots of wives offer sex as a reward for good behavior .  It seems to work so well that they never give it away for free lest they lose that leverage .  Husbands may in turn stop doing anything unless they get a reward for it .  Sick I know but those of you whove been married for a long while know what Im talking about .  The husband or wife who cheats on that marriage is usually desperate for genuine intimacy .  Love that doesnt require a high score on the report card .  The women who use the vagina as a wrench arent terribly happy either and are just as likely to be seduced into the cheat . It is a sad state of affairs .  Unfortunately the young immature guy or gal who cheats early on for selfish reasons pretty much destroys the trust needed to find real intimacy .  He or she will wind up at an early age in the third kind of loveless marriage .  The key I think is to never use sex for leverage .  Never It is a shared intimacy that only the two can share .  If you want a new car or tennis bracelet just ask .  Amaze him with your passion and give him a place of emotional refuge at home .  He will be so grateful that hell bring home gifts on his own .  Those are the best kind .  ,8

what is LC means in a overseas business imports  exports ?  Letters of Credit a commercial letter of credit issued by a bank on behalf of the importer .   In the document the bank agrees to honor a draft drawn on the importer provided the bill of lading and other details are in order .   In essence the bank substitutes its credit for that of the importer .  Obviously the local bank will not issue a letter of credit unless it feels the importer is creditworthy and will pay the draft . The letter of credit arrangement almost eliminates the exporters risk in selling goods to an unknown importer in another country .  ,6
why iam al ways thinking negtively  if want o do some works then first comes in my mind negetive things why ?  hy iam al ways thinking negtively  if want o do some works then first comes in my mind negetive things why if i go for any work first in my mind negitive things only  .  i keep on thinking about negetive things only its comes in chilwood to till noe iam 25 year now so what to do for postive thinks I cant really tell what you are asking ... Are you saying that you dont want to work or .... Ok as far as negative thinking A wise woman once told me Never let a negative thought stay in your mind for more than 3 minutes .   So the next time you find yourself thinking negatively you need to become aware aka selfaware and put a STOP to it .   You are the only one that can controll you and your thoughts .   So if you HONESTLY want to put a stop to it you need to use will power and just Stop what it is that you are doing .   As for work ... Youre NEVER going to become successful if you have a negative attitude .   People dont like hanging around negative people .   No one is going to want to be around you if you bring them down .   So if you want to be successful win friends and influence people you must become the person that you youself would like to be around .  Only you have the power to change .   Next time you find yourself thinking negatively look at you watch give yourself 3 minutes and get over itGood Luck ,2

Should I be angry with my husband ?  We have been married for almost 2 years and together almost 4 .   I grew up an only child and very independent .  My husband claims to be independent but his mother is very controling and ALWAYS did things for both the boys especially him since he was the youngest of the two .   So his independence is nothing like mine .  I love him dearly but he constantly involves his mother in our financial status and asks her for help when we need it .  I understand that being young and married and in school can be hard but I just want both of us to have control over our lives .  When she gets involved all control goes to her and my husband and I fight about that .   He thinks that there is nothing wrong with it but I feel like I am just his roomate who happens to share a bank account .  I hate getting mad at him but not talking to me about and involving his mother does not help .  I am all about communication .  We are both 23 and I feel that we should be dependent only on each other .  Am I wrong for being upse No you are not wrong to be upset  Those are your feelings ,8
Did she really steal ?  One of my best friends has been staying at my house for over three months now because she got kicked out of her home .  We share the same room and all and technically she is allowed to borrow my stuff but she usually asks .  Except this one time .  I had just bought this skirt and never worn it .  I came up one day trying to find it and asked my family if theyve seen it .  They said she had left with it .  Heres the thing when someone confronted her about it her excuse was that it was a joke .  Its been a week and she never gave it back .  I havent really seen her around because shes been at her bf and all .  Alot of people have been telling me she stole .  And that the joke part was really just a coverup because i tend to forgive easily .  Many of my friends said youre too nice and naive you let people walk all over you and you cant get mad when you should be bad .  Is it possible that she might have stole and lied to me ?  What am I suppose to do ?  Just a joke often means somebody covering themselves .  In this case it doesnt sound like a joke .   But covering themselves doesnt necessarily mean she stole it .   She may have felt that she had your permission to borrow things as you implied .   So if somebody confronted her about something she borrowed her automatic response may well have been to become defensive and conver herself .   Im a little confused about her not returning though .   You share a bedroom .   Do you share dressers and closets ?   If she has her own set of clothes and stores it there why not just take it back ?   Surely she hasnt been WEARING it for the past two weeks .   Talk to her about it but dont accuse her .   If she felt she was allowed to borrow your stuff freely its not fair to accuse her of stealing simply because you hadnt worn the skirt yet especially if she didnt know it was brand new or special . Good luck .  ,8

I know Im Prego .  but I have had my period for some time now What does this mean ?????  I had a very light period for a week and thought I was going to luck out this month .   I was about three or four days late for this period and when I got it I was very light .   I found something alarming to say the least and took a pregnancy test and it showed that I am in fact prego  I went to the hospital they did a Sono and could not find anything in my Uterus .   My Betta s are very low around 380 I think  If it is so early in a pregnancy could you see anything anyway ?????   I need to know if you would be able to see the pregnancy through a Sono when Betta s are around 380s ???????  See a doctor ASAP . Home preg tests can be wrong you might have a sexually transmitted infection that is fooling the results .  Or you might have an ectopic pregnancy which means that the embryo has lodged in the tubes and not the uterus .  Left untreated this can be fatal .  You need to see a doctor .  NOW ,2

When will the moon lose orbit from earth ascend away into space ?  The moons orbit is not permanent in what year range will the moon break orbit and become a planet with its own solar orbit .  The moon will not escape Earth orbit .  It is currently moving away from us at only 38 mmyear due to energy transferred by tidal forces .  The energy transfer is also causing Earths day to become longer currently it is increasing by 15 microseconds each year . Theoretically the moons orbit would increase until the Earths day slows to match the Moons orbital period .  After this point solar tides will dominate and the Moon will start moving closer to Earth . Before this happens the Sun will become a red giant 5 billion years from now .  ,1

How can we get the 2 political parties to focus on what our country and earth need and not party interests ?  I am concerned that our 2 political parties focus almost exclusively on their party lines and their party interests to the exclusion of a focus on what needs to be addressed in our country and the earth .  How can we help them refocus their energies where it can do the most good .  We have significant issues facing us as a nation war hunger poverty polution the economy .  Worrying about how to win seats in congress and how to spin bad news and how best to berate the other party doesnt help any of these issues get addressed .  start another party that does focus on the real issues and somebody has . www . unity08 . com ,9
where does the saying send you to coventry come from ?  when someone says ill send you to coventry and they then egnor that person how did that saying come about ?

Bham was always a bigger district and coventry was always a dump so when anyone got into trouble with the law they were sent to work in the dump known as coventry .  It then ended up housing thousands or retards and this is the way it still is today ,3

Could be classify violent illegals as enemy combatants ?  Violent illegals dont care about getting deported so they just smirk their way back to mexico change their name and return .  What if we created a Guantanamo type of island prison for violent illegals ?  Sneaking into someone elses country and killing a legal citizen seems like an act of war to me .  I think in addition to helping mexico build things like schools and roads we should also help them build prisons because they dont seem to be able to keep a handle on their own criminals .  Americas not the worlds dumping ground and the people that come to the US and screw up are often screwups in their home country too .  Jails and prisons dont fix that problem they dont serve to rehabilitate but they do separate such people from the mainstream so that the rest of us can walk down the street and not have to worry about imported violent offenders etc .  Mexicos got social problems .  Somehow the United States ended up in the unenviable position of being expected to help Mexico with their social problems .  Too bad Mexico wont help itself instead theyd rather keep helping themselves to the american taxpayers wallet ....  ,9

How do i know if a girl likes me ?  i many times find myself looking at a girl from far away or close by and im so attracted to her but usually i just turn around immediately cause i feel like im not worth anything to them .  and sometimes i see girls look at me but generally i dont get any clue on if they like me or not ..  However sometimes i keep looking at her look down or to the side and look at her again and she still is looking at me .. thats when i feel mmmm maybe she likes me .  But i could be wrong .  what do generally girls do when they like someone ?   I am a guy and i dont do nothing if anything i just become shy and turn around ..  and i never smile or if i smile its slight and i dont expect nothing back because i know it usually doesnt happen .  If the girl thinks your cute or nice she will probably flirt with you .  Also if the girl looks at you alot she is probably attracted to you .  If she gets nervous or bashful when you talk to her well then she has a major crush on you ,8

Portuguese people can be described as helpfulgood with foreing laguages well at last we try and make an effort to understand them  a bit melancholic and sad our typical music is called fado meaning Fate and its usually a sad and depressing type of song  we hate soccer referees and our politics  sadly our economy is one of the worst in Europe right nowwe love the beach were addicted to soccer and we love to go out to malls have something to drink usually coffee in a coffee shop or in a tavern ...

why does US make it difficult 4 people from east europe who want to travel to US but make it easy for others ?  They dont make it harder for Eastern Europeans than many other nations but some few nations including much of Western Europe DO have an easier access .   This is based upon the risk of visa violations .   It is believed that residents of Norway for example are much less likely to overstay their visas than a resident of Bosnia for example .   But it isnt specific to Eastern Europe .   Most of the world falls into the same category .  ,9

how fast does the world rotates ?  The rotational speed of the Earth at the equator is about 1038 miles per hour . It actuallt depends on where on Earth you are standing .  At the poles the Earth hardly spins at all but as you travel towards the equator the rotational speed picks up .  This makes sense  as the circumference of a circle increases a single point along it has to travel faster to complete a revolution in the same amount of time .  The rotational speed of the Earth at the equator is about 1038 miles per hour .  The atmosphere at the equator is also slightly thicker due to rotation and you weigh slightly less .  At midlatitudes the speed of the Earths rotation decreases to 700 to 900 miles per hour .  If the Earth were to stop spinning suddenly the atmosphere would still be zipping along nicely at around 1000 miles an hour .  As a result everything not attached to bedrock would pretty much be scoured clean .  If you have any more questions about the Earths rotation check out this nifty Ask a Space Scientist page .  Looking for a cosmic perspective on how fast the earth is moving ?  Remember that all questions about motion or speed are only complete with an appropriate frame of reference .  ,1

what are phonetic symbols ?  Phonetic symbols are a set of universally accepted symbols used by linguists so that we know exactly how words are pronounced without knowing the spelling system of each language .   Each phonetic symbol represents only one sound and each sound has only one symbol .   They are written between brackets    .   Thus the English word read is written rid and meet is written mit .   Anyone in the world who knows the phonetic alphabet would know how to pronounce these two words whether they know English or not . The person who wrote phonemic is incorrect .   There is no phonemic alphabet .   Phonemes are based on an analysis of the phonetics of a language and are abstract symbols used to represent a class of sounds allophones that are related to each other by rule .   Phonemic transcription uses phonetic symbols usually written between vergules    thus the phonemic representations of English read and meet are rid and mit .  ,0

why wont the powers that be admit that the bird flu has mutated and is contagoius between humans  ?  Yes it has mutated and IS contagious between humans .   For the H5N1 bird flu virus strain to become a serious threat to human health it will need to mutate further .  At the moment it does not infect humans easily it very rarely jumps from human to human .  However if it infects a human who already has the normal human flu it could then exchange genetic information with the human flu virus and acquire the ability to transmit from humantohuman easily  a new mutation .  Then we could be facing a serious flu pandemic that would spread around the world within a matter of weeks .  ,2

Is it wrong for a Christian to seek help with fertility ?  me and hubby have been trying 3 yrs and no success 1 child 9 yrs we are in our late 20s been checked out so far tests have come back normal we are going to see a fertility specialist  in a couple of days I keep hearing Wait on God in His time and i do believe that but is it really Gods will for 12 yr old to have babies and throw them in garbarge cans ?  Am I wrong for wanting to see whats wrong and getting doctor help ?  I would say no .   There is nothing wrong with asking for help when you need it as far as Im concerned .   However if God is putting a different conviction on YOUR heart that is a different story .   Darling I will pray for you to receive wisdom in your decision .   My best suggestion is for you and hubby to pray together and seperately about it .   Search the Word ask God to give you an answer to your problem .   Dont forget as a Christian anything that is on your heart is also on His .   Only He can tell you what He wants you to do .  ,0

how to calculate the geometric factor for the schlumberger array ?  geo electrical profiling can be done with fixed electrical electrodes and move only potential electrodes .  I would like to know the formula I can use to calculate the geometric factor k for the different spacings The formula will be determined by several factors . Firstly you need to quantify the paralax of your electrodes when taken as a constant then select your test apmere rate .  This must be kept constant to give your results continuity . The geometric factor can be determined either as a spacial value or a multidimensional cascade equation using the derivative of the base line through force as emitted by the polarised ion array under the radial effect of the ipnosis effect which can be detected using the omnidirectional fortence analyser if availableWhen these values are determined you must apply the correct formula which as I have a standard keyboard which doesnt allow formulaic typing Im not going to tell you .  ,1

Have you parked your car in a blue badgefamily car park area without the blue badge or baby with you ?  Why ?  I was always wondering why you think it is OK to do that while these car park areas are specailly arranged for these less advantaged or more needy people .  This may help me to understand and perharps get less angry about it .  If you think it is not OK to do that then why have you done this before ?  Strangely enough parking in a blue badge parking space without a blue badge doesnt annoy me as much as people who use their familys blue badges to park there .   At least parking without a blue badge risks them getting a fine .   According to the most recent census 1 in 5 people in the area I live in a ward of NW London are living on disability living allowance or income support .   If we pretend that is 1 in 10 people who are registered disabled then it explains why I see more abled than disabled people parking in these bays and not getting a ticket  they are able to borrow a badge from people they know . The public building I work in is next to a row of disabled bays and due to laziness not lack of parking space many either park in these bays with a family members badge or they dont park stop in the middle of the road send their children some as young as 4 across this dangerous road to collect something from the building for them .   Personally Id rather theyd park in the disabled bay than see a nervous 4 year old try to dodge the busy traffic again . P . S .  I dont drive so no Ive never done it . Note We do have blue badges in the UK ...  in London at least ...  I think Scotland might have the orange badge ...  but Im not sure .  ,9

What is baptism like in your church ?  I am going to be baptised this summer because I have chosen to walk with the Lord and I asked Jesus into my heart this past year . I was just wondering what baptism was like in your church .  The Rite of Baptism Baptism of Water comes from the Flood Genesis it is the passage from one state to another .  Water is used in various quantities .  John the Baptist baptized in a river however the exact technique is not documented in the Gospels .  There are other sources but I would like to stay focus on the New Testament . Baptism of the Holy Spirit comes in Pentecost when the apostles received the Holy Spirit .  This is documented in Acts and the Epistles . Frankly it does not matter what baptism is like outside of your church .  I am sure that your ministers have the correct biblical sound ritual .  What is important is that  you understand what your passage is from one state to another .  Baptism is admission to the Christian Church the elected . I have tried to show you from the Christian bible what the Rite of Baptism is .  If you have questions you need to be talking with your ministers .  They should be able to explain the ritual as well as the religious signification . If you are interested in biblical description you can go to www . gateway . com and search for the word Baptism . I am happy that you have found Jesus Christ .  You can always find what he says in the Christian bible .  ,0
can you give a very useful meaning of ecology ?  Please ?  lets talk animal  plant ecologyfirst lets say all different types of animals  plants live in the same area maybe  near a river  in a sense each animal can depend on each other .  For example the main staple for bears is salmon .  lets say man pollutes a river and the fish die .  The bear no longer having fish to eat eat more plants instead .  This results in a dramatic decrease of lets say berry plants in one particular area .  If you were to move 10 miles upstream you would be in a separate ecology where the salmons did not die the bears had a blanced diet and the berry plants were abundant . Bigger ecologies lets a lake can literally fall apart and result in the extinction of a particular plant that only grows at that lake . I hope this was helpful ,1

What is the final will of mankind ?  Are everybody satisfied with their life ?  Dear SurendraYour pertinent question and urgent curiosity has unfortunately been buried under more legitimate concerns .  If you dont get an answer within 24 hours it is best to delete your query and ask again . Surendra I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal opinion .  You have been foolish Surendra .  Very very foolish .  Anyone can see that the purpose of Yahoo Answers is to serve as a modern chatroom .  More and more Java programming is becoming less and less supported there is no other method of bringing people together in a social environment than to create PHP scripts where the thinking can be done on the server rather than on your machine .  With that in mind Surendra you should interrogate the shallowminded participants of Yahoo Answers with matters that appeal to their common denominator .  Questions such as How long is the normal tally whacker ?  or My boyfriend says I should dump my hubby what you think ?...  would get you a substantial number of replies . Give up your pursuit of truth and petty wonders Surendra .  Quit asking bland colorless questions .  Are you naive ?  No person who is capable of giving you the answer you hoped for can last while reading though a heap of puddings pies and pastry .  Im only doing you a favor Surendra by giving you a proper admonishment you can now begin to formulate an apology .  When you are ready send your atonement to  And Surendra if you insist upon asking serious questions remember that a few good jolts from a peace officers tazor should bring you around to your senses .  Please check your spelling and throw some slang into the mix so you dont offend any of the egos lurking waiting to pounce with crass thoughtless oneliners . Thank you Surendra and have a great dayGabe ,0
how can you tell the difference ?  How can you tell the difference between a real answer and a fake answer when asking somebody out ? How do you tell the difference between a fake yes and a real yes ?   How can you tell whether a girl is saying yes and is honestly interested in getting to know you or if theyre just out to use you ? How do you tell the difference between a fake no and a real no ?   How can you tell if the person really means no and isnt interested in a relationship or if the person just said no because theyre playing hard to get or are too shy to say yes ? Also how can you tell if somebody is putting you down easy ?   For example if somebody says theyre not ready but really mean theyre not interested in you .   They just dont want to sound rude .  Body language can say a lot .  Is she smiling at you ?  Looking you in the eye ?  Does she laugh a lot or touch her hair or her face or you ?  These are all good signs . If she seems uncomfortable wont look at you is looking down or stays a good distance away from you chances are shes not really interested . And if a girl says no ALWAYS take it as no .  If she meant yes shell come back and let you know .  ,8
what is the most embarrassing thing you have ever done ???  When I was about 5 I begged and pleaded with my uncle to drive his gocart around in this parking lot .  I told him that I knew I could handle it ..   He said this is the gas and this is the brake .  Do not hit them at the same time .   First thing I do with my cousin Brian hanging on the side is jam them as hard and as far as I can go .  Now the thing is JAMMING around the parking lot at full speed with no ability to stop .   My grandpa stood in front of me for a second with his hands out like he could magically make me stop .  Totally hilarious .   My poor cousin Brians knee was totally bouncing on the ground so he tore the heck out of his new courderoy pants and tore up his knee .   My sister described the sound of my voice as AAAAAAAAaaaa hhhhh ..    As I got further away I sounded less loud .   I almost hit a telephone pole ..   Finally I stalled it out in this field with melons in it .. Sheesh ...  what a goof .   Im amazed that I didnt take my poor grandfather out .  ,7
Chemistry Problem .  Can someone EXPLAIN this to me ?  The density of pure silver is 105 gcm at 20C .

Thanks so much D 5 . 25g of silver in terms of volume is  5 . 25g105gcm3  0 . 05 cm3 volume of silver is present .   Since its a solid and does not mix with the water the volume should be additive so the volume should increase by 0 . 05mL ,1

Why are the Movie Previews  called Trailers ?  Film trailers are film advertisements .  They are shown before the screening of another movie at a cinema where the films will be exhibited as well as in the lobby and on Internet .  They are more formally known in theaters as previews of coming attractions .  The term trailer comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a film programme .  Although that practice did not last long due to patrons tending to leave the theater after the films proper were finished the name has stuck .  ,7

why is it so hard to belive there was some kind of coverup on 911 ?  Its our god given right as americans to find criminals and investigate them even if they are high ranking officals .  for all you nay sayers why dont they just answer the real questions about 911 ?  if they are so sure that terrorists committed these acts why cant the government release a few more tapes of the pentagon or answer the real questions ?  if our central millitary complex is not safe from attack what is then ?  they had enough information to know that there was a good chance 911 would happen .  they chose not to act .  thats it . why is it so hard to believe theres a coverup ? think about it .  thousands of ppl dead .  because of something the only thing protecting this country could prevent but didnt ? thats too scary .  its much easier to say theyre dumb ya know idiots .  despite the fact that Bush went to Yale and ishello presidentor that some arab that hates freedom is attacking . to swallow the fact that the govt .  doesnt give a fuck about you and would allow such an atrocity to take place .  is too much for most ppl .  ,9

An exclamation mark is not a valid character for an email address extension or web address so it wouldnt be possible to add it  thats just how it is just like its not possible for me to upload a picture into this answer  someone created the protocols and were bound by them . You can have  in the first part of an email address but not in the part that comes after the dot   xyzyahoo . com is acceptable but xyzyahoo . com isnt . Im guessing that somewhere along the line someone has mistyped your email address or has perhaps copied and pasted it but inadvertently included an exclamation mark . Many people on seeing xyzyahoo . ca would realize it should be xyzyahoo . ca and correct the error themselves but Id suggest you email those people who you suspect may have your email address incorrectly and advise them of the error . Just to clarify this service is something provided by Yahoo which is available for anyone to ask and answer questions on .

how can you separate the homogenous mixture of sugar and salt ?  Scientific Methods please are there certain chemicals ?  or certain catalysts ?  Traditionally salt is removed  from sugar containing solutions by passing the syrup through  columns packed with ionexchange resin beads .  The beads bind the Na and Cl ions and the effluent passing through will be the sugar water solution .  If you wasn to recover the Na or the Cl ions then the beeds are rinsed with either a strong acid or base and quantitave recoveries can be made .  ,1

When does the bible say the earth will end as we know it and how ?  As a result of mankinds fall into sin all creation unwillingly submitted to the slavery of decay and groans and suffers till now Rom .  822 .  The time will come in which mankind and the entire material world will be purified and renewed .  This will occur on the last day following the Universal Judgment and it will happen by means of fire .  As the world that existed before the deluge was purified from sin by means of the flood likewise the present heaven and earth St .  Peter teaches are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men  On that day  the heavens will pass away with a great noise and the elements will melt with fervent heat both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up  Nevertheless we according to His promise look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells 2 Pet .  3713 . The fact that the present temporary world will be transformed was predicted many centuries before Christ by the Psalmist who said Of old You laid the foundation of the earth And the heavens are the work of Your hands .  They will perish but You will endure Yes all of them will grow old like a garment Like a cloak You will change them And they will be changed .  But You are the same And Your years will have no end Ps .  1022527 .  In other words the end of the world will not be its destruction but its total renewal .  ,0

did the mafia and cia really kill kennedy ?  Im not saying that I know for sure who killed JFK but here is something to think about .  JFK s dad was connected to organized crime during prohibition .  He was a bootlegger .  Now fast forward to when JFK was running for president .  He reach out to his friend Frank Sinatra who was friends with Sam Giancana boss of the Chicago Outfit .  Giancana pulled some strings and JFK got elected .  After he was elected Giancana figured JFK owned the mob a favor .  JFK put his brother as Attorney General and both of them went after the mob .  Now fast forward again to the assination and the aftermath .  Whether Oswald was just a fall guy or if he was one of the shooters and yes I said one of the shooters meaning more than one shooter I dont know .  But Giancana being boss of Chicago had ties to New Orleans boss Carlos Marcello who had ties to Dallas and I think you know where I am going with this .  Jack Ruby was connected to the Dallas Family .  He wasnt very important but he still had ties .  ,9

what do U think of the Macbook ?  Im travilling in a few days so I need to decide fast so please help me .. I want to empty my digi cam .  or digi camcorder in itthe photoes . but this isnt the only use 4 me .... Id like a laptop to last long with great features ... do U think macbook is great  ?  why U think soeather U say yes or nowhts its price ?.. if no what do U recommend  why its better ?  I have worked with both Macs and PCs and i totally vote for the macbook .   The operating system is much more stable and will last longer than another laptop because they are built stronger in my opinion .   PCs are good also if you are in an environment that is PC dominated or if you want to try out software software for Macs are limited .   Macs are great if you are doing photos videos and other creative stuff .  I belive Apple also ships their computers rapidly and would receive it much faster than a PC if you are travelling soon .  ,4

Out of curiosity .......?  Why is it that menwho are straight have a hard time dealing with gay men but are willing to see lesbians get it on .  It seems to me that there is a major doublestandard here ......... why ?  i swear to God  its cuz of all the lesbian porn that are around .... they watch it and they ACTUALLY think that its the same in real life ..... try putting a stone butch making love to a lipstick femme  i think theyd head for the nearest exit no offence butches love you guys but i need to make a point  because they are soo used to what the adult film industry or rather their own male ego and chauvanism tell them .... women are created to pleasure my dck and the world revolves around it so the idea of lesbians having sex with them is stroking pardon the pun their egos .  ie they are so good in bed that even lesbians will make an exeption for itanything that threathens their male supremacy is a turnof .  so this explains them not wanting to watch two guys make out ....  hence explaning the stone butch situation too .  butches are a threat to their ego so it will not be tolerated ... as for why do they like to watch it i think if you cant get the real thing .....  stimulation would do just fine ....  lolhope this makes sense ,0
why do we get mouth ulcer ?  The exact cause of mouth ulcers is unknown but in some cases they are thought to be caused by an overreaction by the bodys own immune system .  Factors that appear to provoke them include stress fatigue illness injury from accidental biting hormonal changes menstruation sudden weight loss food allergies and deficiencies in vitamin B12 iron and folic acid .  Some drugs such as nicorandil have been linked with mouth ulcers . Mouth ulcers are thought to form when the body becomes aware of and attacks chemicals which it does not recognize .  The presence of the unrecognized molecules garners a reaction by the lymphocytes which trigger a reaction that causes the damage of a mouth ulcer . Trauma to the mouth is a common cause of mouth ulcers .  Physical trauma such as toothbrush abrasion poking with sharp food accidental biting or dental braces can cause mouth ulcers by breaking the mucous membrane .  Other factors such as chemical irritants or thermal injury may also lead to the development of ulcers .  However in many cases the precise cause is unknown . A common cause of ulcers is gluten intolerance in which case consumption of wheat rye or barley can result in chronic mouth ulcers .  If gluten intolerance is the cause prevention means taking most breads pastas cakes pies cookies scones biscuits beers etc .  out of the diet and substituting glutenfree varieties where available .  Artificial sugars such as those found in diet cola and sugarless gum have been reported as causes of mouth ulcers as well .  They can also be linked to an increased intake of acid such as the acidic form Vitamin C or citric acid .  In this case the sores disappear after intake decreases or a non acidic form of the vitamin is taken . Other disorders can cause mouth ulcers including oral thrush leukoplakia gingivostomatitis and oral lichen planus .  Mouth ulcers are also associated with ulcerative colitis Crohns disease coeliac disease gluten sensitivity bullous pemphigoid and Behets disease .  Repeat episodes of mouth ulcers can also be indicative of an immunodeficiency signalling low levels of immunoglobulin in the mucous membrane of the mouth .  Chemotherapy is a common cause of mouth ulcers .  The treatment depends on the believed cause .  ,2
What is a Daisy wheel printer ?  A daisywheel printer works on the same principle as a ballhead typewriter .  The daisy wheel is a disk made of plastic or metal on which characters stand out in relief along the outer edge .  To print a character the printer rotates the disk until the desired letter is facing the paper .  Then a hammer strikes the disk forcing the character to hit an ink ribbon leaving an impression of the character on the paper .  You can change the daisy wheel to print different fonts .  Daisywheel printers cannot print graphics and in general they are noisy and slow printing from 10 to about 75 characters per second .  As the price of laser and inkjet printers has declined and the quality of dotmatrix printers has improved daisywheel printers have become obsolete .  ,4

Have you read the bookAn Inconvenient Truth ?  Written by Al Gore . It is also on film .  This is a book everyone should read .  No I have not but I plan to when it arrives in my area .  I Strongly doubt everyone will see it though .   Some people are guided by something other than scientific evidence .   For centuries the science community has bumped heads with the establishment .   Peoples set beliefs can prove to be very difficult to change .   Educating the young is most probably the best way to get the job done .   Still Others have such a big stake in the Middle East and its oil that inconvenient truth is a great understatement  . Good luck getting the word out .   Maybe after the movies initial release  it will be available for students to see in their schools  Or maybe it will become available to Public Television viewers .  ,1

what you do feel when your in love ?  Your body releases chemicals that are very similar to tweak as in speed or crystal meth .   So you lose your apatite and feel a bit jittery .   But then when that all wears off if the girl is still as great as when you first started falling in love with her the magic happens .   You feel like you are only really complete when you are together .   Like part of you is missing when she isnt there .   You know you would do anything to save her from a burning building or any other threatening situation even if you know it would kill you .   I have done lots of things like rock climbing jumping out of airplanes and driving 140 mph in a 65 zone but nothing compares to the feeling I get when I look at my wife .  ,8
what would it be the face of middle east if Americanas would not been attack Iraq ?  who would bee the mext victim of Iraq and Iran and Suria  invedors  ???? after kuveitand libanon ......??  Before we invaded Iraqwe had the support of the entire world .  Nobody objected to our going after the Taliban in Afghanistan and we had a coalition of allies who were willing to support our cause .   BushPearleRumsfeldWolfowitzCheney and Rice squandered that good will by deliberately lying to the American people and the world about phoney WMDs .  They also told us that the war would pay for itself with Iraqi oil .  Unfortunately what Bush has accomplished is something no one in history has been able to dohe has turned the entire Islamic world into our enemy .  Instead of them hating the Jews in Israel they now hate us .  This war will never be won by our troops because when you have people willing to blow their selves up for a cause any victory will only come when the last suicide bomber has died .  The Middle east would have been a far more stable region had we not invaded and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians including women and children .  ,9

What advice would you give to a first year PhD student social science ?  Advice from current grad students please ?  1 .  Be an active participant in the community that is your department .   Go to talks and social events .   Get to know the faculty outside your narrow area of interest as well  you never know when those people are going to be able to help you . 2 .  One part of department culture you should avoid at all costs is the gossip .   Academic disciplines are all about networking and reputations so if possible you want people to like and trust you . 3 .  You WILL be overwhelmed and generally stressed out all the time .   Just dont let other people know it .   You are likely to have at least minor meltdowns from time to time  just be sure to do it at home away from your colleagues .   Anytime youre in the department or with colleagues do your best to act calm and confident and refrain from complaining too much .   Bitching about work was cool as an undergrad now you need to act like a professional . 4 .  Most people I know didnt go into graduate school with a dissertation topic so if you dont have one dont panic .   Read as much as you can talk over ideas with your adviser and use your term papers to testdrive ideas youre interested in .   Ultimately you have to pick a project that really captivates you because youve got to make yourself give at least a few years of your life over to it . Mostly being successful in graduate school is something you have to learn by experience .   Listen to the older graduate students and dont let the overwhelming feelings cloud your better judgment .   Good luck ,3

I have homosexual feelings and ive acted on it will i go to hell ?  ive been like this ever since i was born will i go to hell .  plz help . what should i do ?  Yes theres a possibility that you could go to Hell if you dont turn away from your sins .  Because you feel that you have been feeling this way since you was born then you will have to seek Gods face .  God can help you to change if that is what you want .   First realize that you are not in your natural state that God perfer you to be in then know that it is not normal repent to God and dont miss a day asking for forgiveness and praying .  God has got to know that this is what you really want .  How about making a promise to God that if he would restore your natural state back that you will serve him forever .  Just trust him and be patient with God .  It may look like he will never answer but he will if you do your part .  But dont worry because worry brings on doubt and doubting God is only saying I dont trust you Lord And while you are trusting God separate yourself from any negativity in your life .  Get away from any porn movies magazines etc .  Get away from any of your friends that may be homosexuals .  You have to make that first serious step and then God will gladly trust you enough to help you to change .  Please follow up and be strong .  ,0

How do let a guy know that you like him without scaring him away and  not ruin our friendship ?  Friendship ?  A friendship between a man and a woman is not what you girls call a friendship .  It is a mild attraction based purely on a future date in which you will have sex with them when you are totally desperate that is masked by a mild interest in what the other is saying .  If you have a friendship with a guy it just means that you are using him or he is using you and oneboth of you expects sex andor money at some future date . So dont worry about it and let him know .  You might find that he will give you your payment early .  Either way you will get what you deserve .  ,8

And this was after a season that had some pitfalls until Meyer adjusted his spread option scheme at midseason to accommodate quarterback Chris Leaks dropback passing talents .  Though top receiver Chad Jackson has split for the pros Andre Caldwell and Dallas Baker make for some inviting downfield targets for the strongarmed Leak .  Caldwell missed most of last season with a broken leg after catching 43 passes for 689 yards in 2004 .  During the offseason Meyer expressed chagrin over the situation at tailback saying hell play without one unless someone takes charge .  The starter is DeShawn Wynn .  All three of the backs who played significantly last fall are back and Wynn a senior who has run for 19 touchdowns over his career could finish with a bang .  But hell have to do it behind an offensive line that returns only one starter  Steve Rissler who is moving from guard to center .  The Gators will field the best defensive line in the SEC .  End Jarvis Moss led the team with 11 tackles for a loss and 7 . 5 sacks and he was only used in passing situations .  Tackle Marcus Thomas broke through for 10 . 5 tackles behind the line .  Florida is also blessed with two of the leagues most talented linebackers in Earl Everett and Brandon Siler the teams top two tacklers from a year ago .  But as formidable as the defensive front appears the secondary needs three new starters .

Whats the best computer degree ?  Undecided which field of computers I want to work in .  Please help .  Thanks ?  Computer Science is more softwareoriented writing software artificial intelligence algorithms . Computer Engineering is more hardwareoriented Computer Hardware Design hardware architecture and software development for hardware devices . MIS is more the IT type degree ..  managing systems programming for these systems ..  etcYou just have to consider what you want to do  would you like developing software full time ?  developing hardware full time ?  or managing systems full time ? that said CS is probably the most dynamic of degrees ..  since you do learn a bit of everything .   Youll probably need to take more math courses in either CS or CE than in MIS ..  while MIS has business classes you must take since technically its a business degree  at least at my uniand there are quite a few classes that both CS and CE majors take together again at least at my uni ..  so with respect to these CS and CE are more alike than MIS is to either of the two . best though is dependent on you alone ..  you have to decide what you want to do with your life ..  That said software engineeringdevelopment was just named the best job by money magazine .   Im unsure at this point if id agree as my software engineering courses were pretty crappy for me  high stress level poor professor ridiculous amount of work per week  but like I said before this is a personal thing ..  different people work better in different places doing different things . Take some classes try to talk to some professors and ask questions ..  go to university websites and search for specific classes from the CS CE or MIS departments as many of them have online pages for specific classes including the syllabus  ..  youll be able to gauge if you are interested in the concepts lectured this way ..  at least to some degree . best of luck . c  ,3

Do you agree that despite all of the flaws of modern Christians GOD will still get them into Heaven ?  It appears that the average Christian does not truly understand GOD or the Bible .  ALL of them will profess that it is impossible to understand GOD and most of them will quote off scripture to support that claim .  Be that as it may Christians are not entirely without hope . Luckily Christians spend their entire Christian lives huddled around a flaming pile of unrefined scripture to get a good idea of what it means to be right by GOD .  Although the average Christian might have an understanding of the Bible that sounds like the lost lyrics to Jesus Loves Me it is very possible that with the right stimulation a person could come the rest of the nine yards in a relatively short amount of time . Long question short do you feel that there are new options opened up to those that satisfy certain prerequisites like asking GODs forgiveness accepting Jesus or baptisma jesture ? AdderAstrosPowerful Member of the House of Light . xxxxx .  If there are such places as Heaven and Hell I believe that people will go where they belong .

All we can do is pray for them when they are not here and love them like there is no tomorrow when they are home .   I knew what I was getting into when I married him and as much as I hate him being gone every other year I have to live with it that is the job of a military wife . God Bless All Our Troops ,9

There is one man that has a dispute with some other man and on the dispute he goes and kills him .  The the son of the dead man has to go and kill the killer .

Why are Australias colors in the World Cup green and yellow and not the colors on their flag ?  Well I have read all the responses so far and I must say that some are very amusing but so far only one of these is close .   That is this one   the real answer is at the bottom please read on . Green and gold are the national colours of Australia as proclaimed by Sir Ninian Stephen the Governor General of Australia on 19 April 1984 .  The exact colours were specified as being Pantone Matching System numbers 116C and 348C .  Green and gold are also the traditional team colours of Australian national sporting teams .  Nearly every current Australian national sports teams wears The Green and Gold although the hues and proportions of the two colours may vary between teams and across eras .  It is widely believed that the colours were chosen because they are the dominant colours of Australias floral emblem the Golden Wattle . You will find that every major Australian national team wears green and gold including most notably the two time world champion Wallabies of Rugby the Socceroos of the World Cup and the Olympic team .  Sourceswikipedia . org  Real AnswerThe official colours of Australia are BLUE AND GOLD ...  Not Green and Gold Green and Yellow or any other colours of the rainbow or anything else that the so called greenies or hippies or even other minority group may wish to conjure up .   If you go to Parliment House and read the constitution  not that many of obviously have or have the ability to you will find amongst the small print that the national colours for the reprsentaion of this great land of ours called Australia are Blue and Gold ...  the reason that we portray Green and Gold is for our sporting teams and that is due to the above mentioned clours of the Wattle flower and tree .  Now before you so called experts try to smack me down with all your references and alke I suggest you visit the National Capitol and see the constitution for yourself .  Also take the time to read it if your able to that is  and you will no doubt see that I am correct and you are misinformed ..  I hope that this had shed a bit of light on your dilemma or at least given more ammunition for a good arguement as I really do enjoy that ..  ,5

Biotechnology  an exciting new job oppurtunity or a legislative time bomb ?  What are your thoughts .?  Its a relatively new field but is it really going to last despite all its potential ?  I hope so since I have a Bachleors in Biotechnology .  Right now the job market is very good but like Stephanie said science jobs pay very little I know that better than anybody .   In regards to if it will last that depends on what field of biotechnology you are refering to .  From the way you worded your question I am assuming you are talking about the more controversial areas and Id have to say since this country is so conservative that will probably continue to stand in the way of our advancement in the scientific field .  This is unfortunate because we will probably find the U . S .  falling behind the rest of the world in this aspect .  ,1

What did you learn about Leonardo Da Vinci that you did not know before after the Da Vinci COde ?  Well Id say that I didnt learn allot directly from the book .   Most of the stuff that I learned about him were from the countless documentaries that saturated the education channels during the controversy of the Da Vinci Code .   I learned that he was an outcast due to the fact that his parents were from two classes of society and therefore forbidden to marry .   I learned that although the church contracted him to paint many paintings he never quite gave them exactly what they wanted and he was asked to repaint at least one of his paintings .   He was brilliant .   Much more intelligent than I ever thought .   He was truly a Renascence man .  ,0

Why is it that men say they are going to do something and then dont do it ?  Maybe I get my hopes up to easily or am too trusting but when someone says theyre going to do something I wish they would do it .  I also know that it isnt just men that do this .  Women do the same thing .  they arent very assertive and believe people wont like them if they stand their ground .

what is the byzantine catholic rite church ?  I am a roman catholic .  I walked in to a byzantine catholic church by mistake and thought it was a catholic one because of its similariity from the outside and the chants .  Everything was going ok except that the priest was on his back but i thought what the hell ?  they did this a long time ago anyways ...  and then  At the time of communion the priest got a spoon and fed everyone a spoonfull of something that tasted like fruitpie and wine ..  what was that ?  I couldnt get out of the line so i had to take te spoonfull ..  lol what was it ?  what are the differences between roman catholics and byzantine catholics ?  why does the priest give mass on his back ?  please help me understand where i went and what i tasted  thanks You were most likely attending a Catholic Mass in an Eastern Rite Byzantine Catholic Church which is probably fully in union with the Holy See at the Vatican but using a different liturgy than western Roman Catholics are used to .   You should have just stayed around after Mass and asked these questions to the priest .  You likely received both the body and the blood of Christ at the same time rather than separately .

What happens  at a statutory rape case In California ?  How does it go about ?  is there a jury ?  Does the prosevutor take the stand for a minor or do the parents need to hire an attorney ?  What kind of questions are asked ?  Every case is unique but the general procedures are like any criminal trial .     The case is called the charges are read and the defendant enters a plea .   A jury is empaneled unless the defendant waived the right to a jury trial .   Both sides present their opening statements .   The prosecution presents its case along with any witnesses .   The defense crossexamines the witnesses .   The defense presents its defense .   The prosecution crosses the defense witnesses .   Motions are dealt with as the matters arise .   Both sides present their closing arguments and it goes to the jury .   The jury deliberates and renders its verdict .   The verdict is read and the defendant is either scheculed for sentencing if found guilty or released if found not guilty . A guardian adlitem may be appointed by the court to protect the rights and interests of the minor . Attorneys involved in a case rarely take the stand theyre there to try the case or represent the defendant .   Theyre not witnesses . The specific questions asked by either side depend upon the facts and circumstances .   Again every case is unique .   The minor victim may or may not need to take the stand .  ,9

If I cant see it then it must not exist ... child thinking ?  I hear this argument from athesists but can you think of other things that exist that you cannot reach out and touch something tangible like hatred prejudice etc . Dogs hear what we cant Bats see what we cant and Bees see a flower much differently than you and I ... If I have no valid proof of something and my senses cannot detect it is this by default a valid argument that it must not exist ?

why does it seem like nice men always come in last ?  it just seems to me that nice men always comes in last on the dateing scene .  Hi KennethI know what you mean .   I am a nice woman and put try to take advantage all the time ... I mean actually I am a converted bitch  I decided being a bitch wasnt good ... I am now respectful of all things being a Wiccan .   But so many idiots try to take advantage so I put magickal shields around me  ... it bounces off me and goes back on them  The other thing is that so many women say they want a nice guy but are attracted to the proverbial bad boys .   Its time ladies to take stock of that  The bad boys are going to be bad to you too ... eventually not at first while theyre still lusting strong for you ... but after a few years of marriage ... you go way down on their list  ladies you need to rationalize that and give up that bad boy attraction .   When I did I began to recognize all those wonderful loving nice guys around ... previously they were invisible to me .   Then I married one great nice sweet guy ... not a bad guy ... but a really nice one .   And we live happily ever after now more than 11 years  Try it youll like it .   I think it is all part of our cultural stuff here .  ,2

who is more dangerous iran or israel ?  Israel is the most dangerous country in the area .   They have a nuclear arsenal and have been known to take the offensive against any threat to them .   They bombed an Iraqi nuclear development site 1015 years ago because they felt threatened .   I wouldnt be surprised if they do the same to Iran  They were attacked by many Islamic countries a few decades ago and they kicked all their buts ... in about 4 days .   They are strong have great intelligence and they have powerful weaponry that they arent afraid to use in the defense of their country .   Iran is a threat to givesell their nuclear knowledge to terrorists but they couldnt even beat Iraq in their wars .   Look how fast Iraq fell to the US ... Israel could have done it pretty much that fast  Hope this helps .  ,9

Why are people today so confused about their gender roles and identity ?  Isnt confusion the first thing that Satan wants for us in his plan to try to drag us all down to hell with him ?  You know most people are not confused about their role or identity  usually if there is confusion it is on the part of society with the role or identity an individual assumes .   Its a wide and wonderful world and it is great that each of us can be and try anything we like  and every experience comes with a great lesson or bit of wisdom .   And personally I think the Enemy is our own self doubt and fears  we drag our own selves down enough just look around .   We dont need a horned little imp to make our lives hell very often we do a fine job all on our own .  ,0

What do you do when a relative of your husband approaches you in a sexual manor ?  On Fathers Day of last year my husband and I went to a Fathers Day dinner at his aunts house .   He left with a few of the other dads to ride their motorcycles while I stayed with the mothers and the children .   Unfortunately I had to work that day and I was rather tired .   I went to lay in one of the childrens rooms with a couple of the little children that were already asleep .   While I was sleeping I was awaken by someone rubbing my shoulders and stroking my hair .   I thought it was my daughter because she does that from time to time .   Well I went to sit up and saw that it was not my daughter but my husbands cousin .   I jumped up and started cursing her because SHE made me rather uncomfortable .   She goes on to tell me that she has been wanting me since she first met me while my husband and I were just dating 12 years ago .   She also tried to go on about what she wanted to do to me .   This is my hubbys family and I am not comfortable around her .   What do I do ?  you have been open with her that you do not want her attention .   you might let your husband know about it so he is aware of what happened but not push it further .   she most likely will leave you alone from now on give it a chance .  if she doesnt stay away from where she is going to be if she makes you uncomfortable .  ,8

Would you mail a birthday card to a close friend who hasnt answered your emails ?  I have a very close friend who lives on a different continent than me .   I sent her an email three weeks ago and she hasnt written back .   I know that she has been online regularly since I sent the email as our mutual friends have mentioned chatting on MSN which I dont use .   Her birthday is coming up and I feel kind of bitter about sending a card when she cant be bothered to reply to my email .   Do you think I should send her a proper card a quick email or nothing at all ?   Why ?  Wow I went through something similar .  I would mail the card and continue to be a good friend .  So when you reach the point of confrontation you could say that you upheld your end of the bargain by being a loyal friend .  Any chane in attitude will lead to both sides being bitter .  Remember be who you were and do what you normally do until you can find out why things are the way they are .  Relax and think it through .  ,0

What was your favorite part of middle school ?  When I was in 7th grade there was a bully who sat in the desk next to mine in history class .   Every time the teachers back was turned hed lean over and punch me hard on the arm .   By the end of each day my arm was covered in bruises . One day I got some cloth ribbon and some heavy tape and fashioned an armband out of it with sharp thumbtacks sticking out .   I concealed this under my sleeve the next day before class . After that day he never hit me again .   That was my favorite day in junior high school .  ,3

How many of you havent realized ...?  that our socalled far left liberal friends here are using the same fearmonger tactics that they accuse neocons of ?   Or how quickly they can quote Goebbels and his use of repeating a lie so often that it becomes truth ?   Pot calling the kettle black ?   Hypocrites to the nth degree ?   Should we let them fester in their own hatred and stop even acknowledging their sly propoganda ?   Dont get me wrong either Im not a Republican or neocon but I do love America and hope to see it return to what it can be a proud republic that stands for something other than party hatred .  This is at times a gladitorial arena .  Sure theres hand grenades and flame throwers aplenty but at times that is just the nature of the contest . Truly I feel it gives people a place to vent their anger and frustration among other things .  Its also a place where wit and humor come out . I enjoy reading the comments the trading of accusations and insults the raw feelings that come out from both sides and its safe .. For my real meat and potatoes I go to forums and discussions at Stanford University which is near by .  I also show up at fund raisers for our local politicians we had an election here a few weeks ago . Sometimes it does seem kinda crass and rough but better to get these feelings out in a safe environment than to let them stew unabated . And one more thing I HAVE heard some interesting remarks from the other side that have made me think .  They have good people on their side no doubt about it .  After all they are products of a great country .  We all are .  ,9
Why do I have vibrating electric like needles in my left arm ?  I have had these feelings of needles or vibrating nerve like endings from my elbow up to the left shoulder and neck and head left side only .   Im taking increased meds for trigeminal neuralgia but that hasnt touched it .   I cant remember stretching or falling within the month period that this has been happening .   I saw an MD who suggested an up dose of my Neurontin but nothing has stopped the vibration like ache .  Anyone have anything like this  ?  It could be a prob with one of the nerves in your arm the ulnar or median .  See your dr for EMG testing .  ,2

how do they perform a 4 12 hour cardio stress test ?  I am scheduled to have this stress test next week .  I cant figure out why it takes so long to perform .  I am a nuclear medicine technologist .   And I think you are talking about a cardiac stress imaging test .   I dont know exactly how the facility you are doing it at does theirs theres several ways to do it .   I am assuming it is the reststress method .   So what they will do is inject you with a radioisotope while you are at rest wait about 20 minutes and image your heart for about 15 minutes or so .   Then you come back in about 12 hours and they will run you on the treadmill to reach your target heart rate once in is reached they will inject a radioisotope again while your heart is in a stress state .   They will put you on the camera again and image your heart for 1520 minutes .   This time they will hook up some ekg leads to synchronize your heartbeat with the camera .      The purpose of imaging your heart in a rest and stress state is to find spots where the radioactive medicine didnt perfuse to in the heart muscle .   When you exercise the coronary arteries dialate and blood usually perfuses to the heart muscle better .   Now if the pictures show an area where there was no perfusion on rest and stress images that means that is dead muscle that cannot be repaired by increasing perfusion to the muscle it probably died when you had a heart attack or some chest pain over time .   But if the images show a area that didnt perfuse on rest but then it did get blood to it when you exercised and opened up those coronary vessels then it is fixable .   They will probably put in a stent andor do blood thinner therapy to get blood to that heart muscle so it doesnt die .  ,2
Finance Major looking for guidance ?  I have one year left in my finance degree and i am having trouble deciding whether to continue on for my masters or stop after this year .   I am looking for advice from other finance majors and your thoughts as to how important the higher education is and what kind of additional oppurtunities would be available to me if I remained in school ?   am an accounting and finace major student .  This is my last semester .  I will continue to a masters degree in accounting and finace .  My advice is continue i a different school from yours and country .  Finace is wide so there is a way to go .  t is not so important for a marketing major to make masters degree but i think its important for finance .  You can continue in England .  They have one year masters programs and they are very good .  I will go to LSE next year .  Good luck ...  ,6

Why are banks bad ?  If you watch those Ditech commercials you would come to that conclusion .   Do you agree with those commericals ?  Even though I have had a bad experiencethe bank misrespresented credit file doesnt mean all of them are bad right .  I wont mention the bank because that would be rudeex .  Suntrust heh .   If banks are not bad why do we have finance Title and Payday loans companies who OVERCHARGE people ?  Bad is relative and subjective different for every person a perception . The Federal Reserve Act is the tail that wags the dog and is unconstitutional .  The Federal Reserve is a private institution run by a few very powerful men that decide the fate of our economy . Is that bad ?  I would say so .  Not what our forefathers intended .  Youre complaining about nickels and dimes .  The whole thing is a scam .  ,6

why is crystal meth so addicting ?  Because it is a drug and drugs affect your brain .  They send litle chemicals called neurotransmitters into your neurons and give a certain feeling .

what can i do with not so good credit and 4 days til they start forclosure on my home ?  no payday loans no one to lend a hand .  i dont want to move out i fell behind when the doctor that i work with got fired You dont have a lot of options .  Unless you can come up with your arrears in a hurry your best bet would be to contact one of the many companies that offers rapid purchase of your home and sell it to them .  If you owe less than the home is worth you get some money to start over and no matter what you owe you avoid foreclosure which will haunt your credit rating for years .  You can also let the lender know you have a sale pending which should halt the foreclosure for at least a week or two giving you time before the sale to find somewhere else to live .  ,6

is it illegal to purchase the book behold a pale horse ?  i want to read it because i heard it contains great info .  but my cousin said ill get in trouble if i buy it ?  why ?  Its not illegal to buy the book but perhaps the contents of the book may be controversial .  I havent read the book but heres a summary of the Behold A Pale Horse from wikipedia . Behold a Pale Horse is a 1991 book by William Milton Cooper .  ISBN 0929385225Written after Cooper had been a member of the US Naval Intelligence Briefing Team of the Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet the book details many of Coopers claims about the alleged influence of UFOs on US government agencies the New World Order the assassination of President John F .  Kennedy the Apollo hoaxes and other topics . Another claim made in the book pertains to his own death .  William Cooper seemingly paranoid claimed that he would be shot to death on his own property .  True to his fate he was gunned down in precisely this manner years after publishing the book and settling down in Arizona .  However prior to his move Cooper had confided to a neighbor of many years that he expressed a wish to be involved in a shootout with Federal employees in order to vent his anger about the government . The title of the book alludes to a passage in the Bible Revelation 68 And I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him .  ,9

Can anyone explain me what is the PRSI exactly ?  Thanks a lot .  Most employers and employees over 16 years of age in Ireland pay social insurance contributions into Irelands national Social Insurance Fund .  In general the payment of social insurance is compulsory .  Irelands Social Insurance Fund is made up of a current account and an investment account managed by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance respectively .  The current account consists of monies collected from people in employment .  This money is then paid back to fund social insurance benefits and entitlements .  The investment account is a savings account that is managed by the Minister for Finance .  The Comptroller and Auditor General has responsibility for ensuring that the accounts are kept in order and reports are made to the Houses of the Oireachtas .  If you are in employment the amount of social insurance you pay depends on your earnings and the type of work you do .  Your social insurance contributions in Ireland are referred to as PRSI Pay Related Social Insurance .  Sometimes you will hear people describe their PRSI record as stamps .  This term dated from before 1979 when employers would literally stamp a card each week of employment .  That card was then brought to a local social welfare office in order to claim social welfare payments .  Since 1979 your employer keeps a record of the insurance contributions you make .  These monies are now collected by the Revenue Commissioners who in turn make annual returns of these records to the Department of Social and Family Affairs .  All records of your insurance contributions are kept by the PRSI Records section in the Department of Social and Family Affairs .  Social insurance ratesFor people in employment in Ireland social insurance contributions are divided into different categories known as classes or rates of contribution .  The type of class and rate that you pay is determined by the nature of your work .  For example a person employed in a supermarket earning less then 38 euro per week will be insured under Class J .  If that person earned over 38 euro they would probably be insured under Class A .  In fact most employees in Ireland pay Class A PRSI .  This class of contribution may entitle you to the full range of insurancebased benefits that are available from the Department of Social and Family Affairs .  The other classes of social insurance are classes C D B E H J S K M and P .  If you are insured under one of these classes you are paying insurance at a lower rate than Class A contributors which means that you are not entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits .  This is because you are paying less towards social insurance than a Class A contributor .  Example Joe earns less than 38 euro per week .  He is insured under Class J which only entitles him to Occupational Injuries Benefit .  Details of the different groups and occupations that these classes apply to and the benefits covered are contained in the Department of Social and Family Affairs Booklet SW14 .  Also available from your local social welfare office .  If there is a problem in deciding what class of social insurance you should pay the Scope Section in the Department of Social and Family Affairs may decide the issue after examining your employment situation .  How is social insurance PRSI paid ? If you are an employee your social insurance contributions are deducted by your employer and collected by the Revenue Commissioners .  The Revenue Commissioners then pay the money into the Social Insurance Fund .  A record of the contributions you have paid is then sent to the Department of Social and Family Affairs .  Your employer will also pay social insurance on your behalf .  As well as paying into the Social Insurance Fund you will also be expected to pay what is called the Health Contribution which is charged at 2 on all income .  The Health Contribution is not paid into the Social Insurance Fund .  This money is collecte ,6

Will the real me please stand up ?  How can I just be myself ?  Today at work I was on the phone being very professional and polite and someone stopped by my desk and said you sure act diffrerent on the phone than you do in person and with people . I said it gets nauesiated being polite all the time I just like to let it all hang out she laughed and walked away . There is a part of me that always wants to be well liked and well received by others .  Deep down inside I am loving and gentle and kind hearted but there are times more often than not that I have hardened my heart and become loud obnoxoius and over bearingI just received an email about being christ like and sharing Gods love to those who are hurting and I welled up with tears and started to cry .  I the midst of living life I forgot what it is like to really feel . I dont want to put up a front and be someone I am not I have been hurt many times please pray for me that the real me will come forth and that I would serve God with a loving heart .  I think your last statement says it all youve been so hurt that you no longer want anyone to see you how you really are unless you are sure they will not hurt you . This is not the way to love people and its not the way Jesus would want you to live .   Yes people will hurt you in mental and physical ways sometimes .   But you will survive .   Thats part of why Jesus says we should turn the other cheek .   Because loving someone means letting them hurt you on occasion  ...  because they are hurting too . People hurt me all the time they say mean and vicious things to me and I let them because its just a hurt its not my soul .  ,0
why was the treaty of versailles unsuccesful ?  or what did the leaders do to make it unsuccesful ?  this is for an essay so if you could list some oints or sources or anything that will help me write this The treaty was unsuccessful . They put all the blame on Germany . They did not stick to their word and give Italy the territories they wanted .  By putting the entire blame on Germany and compelling them to pay a huge war indemnity they hurt the German people who suffered during the Depression . Hitler was a charismatic orator who proved to the German people that the Treaty Of Versailles was a great injustice and they followed him into war . This is how Hitler was successful in arousing German nationalismNazism and offcourse starting the second world war . Personal opinionPersonally I believe the Treaty was a great bane for the Germans who suffered from years of unemployment and poverty . If the conditions of the Treaty were a  little more mild the Germans would probably have not taken Hitler upon his word .  ,3

What would you do ?  I was finally able to break up with a man I know will not make me happy .   I did fall in love with him but he is too imature among other things .   I would like to keep in touch but everythime I see him he tries to sleep with me .   I no longer feel the need to be with him but do care for him . What can I do to make him undestand that I need my space . I need to put my thought together  figure out what I want . He seams to think I belong to him .  Leave him .   You are no good for him .   By this I mean you must be a happy complete person before you get in a relationship .   It is not a partners responsibilty to make you happy .   You dont need to make him understand .   Ending it is enough .   Its his responsibility to make his peace with it not yours . Reflecting on your life and figuring out what you want is great .   And things change so its a good idea to stay in touch with yourself cuz your wants can change . No one belongs to anybody again his problem to deal with .  ,8

How can I get a higher score on the GRE ?  Ive been studying vocab words but it is so tedious and they arent sticking in my head When taking your test double check your answers as you go unless you begin to see this will not allow you to finish .  This will probably save you time instead of having to reread everything and will also keep you aware of how you are progressing time wise .  Also check the instructions to see if their are actual deductions for wrong answersif you run out of time and randomly answer the last ones it might statistically detract from your score .  A lot of posthigh school tests do that .  ,3

It still does not help I still get them ..  I just developed them within the last year .  what is going on ?  I had the same problem I think it was switching to a natural deodorant that did it .  But there was a good topical solution that I used also but that is from a private label not available in stores .  ,2

Was there damage from the meteorite that struck Norway on Wednesday ?  Also this photo doesnt look like it was taken at night interested to see more photos .  The earth is bombarded with  1000 metric tons of meteroite PER DAY so this is not an exceptional event on a global basis .   Remember that 70 of the earth is uninhabited and not under surveillance . As to comparing it with Hiroshima this is a typical media exaggeration .   My calculations show that with a 100 kg meterorite traveling at 11000 ms the maximum speed it could attain coming from outer space the energy would be about 114000th of the nuclear energy released from the conversion of 0 . 1 gram of uranium into energy by the Einstein relationship E  mc2 ,1
Does the NFL invest enough time and money to assure a rapid expansion of American Football In Europe and asia ?  In todays era of 600 million dollar stadiums billions of dollars of TV broadcast contracts and NFL merchandise selling like hotcakes throughout the world would it be more feasible to Reinvest more here in Europe and elsewhere ?  As a head coach in Europe I know all to well the largest problem facing any new team is ...  Equipment .  This is a problem on the highest level equal to going to Houston Texas and asking every boy in every public high school to bring 300 or more for his new Hockey equipment ....  HARD SELL .  However by funding equipment to all New Teams that meet certain criteria rapid expansion can be proficient and in the end profitable for everyone involved in the greatest sport ever played . Your comments are welcome ... Mike Sholars Head Coach Vejen Vultures AFC If any league could afford to fund developmental leagues in Europe for an American sport its the National Football League .   Probably the best bet would be to contact the NFL and its sponsors to see if they would be interested in a developmental deal where the equipment companies can fully fund the teams needs in return for sponsorship opportunities .  ,5

Do you believe in love at first sight ?  Only in fiction TV and Hollywood .  You love a car at 1st sight .  A dog at 1st sight .  Maybe even a house .  But with people it is lust at 1st sight then maybe some love grows out of it .  Usually once the hot fire of lust cools the relationship goes South because there is nothing to anchor it on .  If it were love at 1st sight 95 of the people would marry and stay married to those they were dating .  That dont happen .  Reality sets in and you find out someone is too clingy too sloppy too jealous too lazy hot headed has too much baggage etc .  If it were love you would look pass ALL of that and want them as Forest Gump wanted Jenny no matter how much they screwed up or rejected you .  You would wait forever and endure all for real love .  Does that happen ?  Love at 1st sight only exist in Hollywood TV and in the movies .  ,8

what is computational biology ?  should i take it in university if i didnt take biology before that ?  mBioinformatics and computational biology involve the use of techniques from applied mathematics informatics statistics and computer science to solve biological problems .  Research in computational biology often overlaps with systems biology .  Major research efforts in the field include sequence alignment gene finding genome assembly protein structure alignment protein structure prediction prediction of gene expression and proteinprotein interactions and the modeling of evolution . The terms bioinformatics and computational biology are often used interchangeably although the former typically focuses on algorithm development and specific computational methods while the latter focuses more on hypothesis testing and discovery in the biological domain .  Although this distinction is used by National Institutes of Health in their working definitions of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology it is clear that there is a tight coupling of developments and knowledge between the more hypothesisdriven research in computational biology and techniquedriven research in bioinformatics .  Computational biology also includes lesser known but equally important subdisciplines such as computational biochemistry and computational biophysics . A common thread in projects in bioinformatics and computational biology is the use of mathematical tools to extract useful information from noisy data produced by highthroughput biological techniques such as genomics The field of data mining overlaps with computational biology in this regard .  A representative problem in bioinformatics is the assembly of highquality DNA sequences from fragmentary shotgun DNA sequencing while in computational biology a representative problem might be statistical testing of a hypothesis of common gene regulation using data from mRNA microarrays or mass spectrometry .  ,1

What started the Vietnam war and how does it compare to the war in Iraq ?  People often talk about Iraq having similarities to Vietnam .  Why did the Vietnam war happen ?  Some of the other answers have good points but  ....  What actually started the Vietnam War will always be debateable . Ive studied Vietnam and the Vietnam war for many years and I continue to find more questions than answers about the war .  One thing I can tell you for sure is the war was inevitable however U . S .  involvement was not .  You can trace reasons why the war started back into the mid1800s when the French colonized Vietnam Cambodia and Laos in creating what was then Indochina .  Vietnam has a very long history literally 1000s of years fighting against those who had tried to occupy or control their country .  Sooner or later the Vietnamese people would rise up to kick the French out of their country as they have with the Chinese Japanese and Mongols in the past .  When the French failed to keep their promise of independence to Vietnam after WWII all hell broke loose to say the least .  For lack of better words the U . S .  and its coalition yes there were other countries that fought with the U . S .  in  Vietnam became involved to clean up Frances mess .  This snowballed into a much bigger conflict than the one that France was involved in .  It could be seen that the Iraq and Vietnam Wars are similar on the surface but theyre actually worlds apart in just about every aspect .  To consider these war similar in any way other than coincidential would be due to ignorance and lack of knowledge of either conflict and the countries involved .  ,9

TekInterface has approached me to build my web site ?  TekInterface is a Nepal based software solution provider .  It is offering me a good price .  Can you suggest me ways to judge the company ?  I mean the quality of work it will be able to give me ...  and also that it will not dupe me once it gets some advance or sth .  Hmmmmm how did they reach you ?   Where you enquiring with them or did you approach other companies and somehow these fellows found out ? Do you have a website at the moment that needs a new look ?   I know how can a question spawn so many more ... As I dont have those particulars I am going to base my answer on the possibility that this company located and approached you without any involvement on your part . You are heading in the right direction by not signing anything agreeing to anything or allowing any kind of work to proceed until you are able to check the company and its quality of work out . Actually I like very much the Request Form they have .   Excellent and well put togetherthought out .   In short if they put as much thought into the design of a site as they have into that form ... they could be a good source . They do have some issues however   links on their own site that should connect to another page of information are not consistent ... some work some dont .   Not a good thing but not a disaster either ... someone should be checking the integrity of the site regularly tho . Im not at all impressed with the presentation of their portfolio .   A portfolio should incorporate examples of a companys work not simply a list of the types of industry theyve worked for particularly if they are attempting to attract design and development work for websites . They do claim that they never make unsupported claims under their About Us section so take them up on it ... ask to see or be given links that verify work done by them . Their website overall is very understated and a little bit bland for a design firm but they do have other offerings as well so I will give them that .   If you think the price fair and the work samples good the references they provide are valid ... then you might just have a good design company . Go with caution tho . Good luck ,4

Town Rd .  in Massachusetts washed out and damaged landscape of property .?  The Town Road has washed out my driveway and exposed the cement pillars to the side door deck .   When I go into the driveway the car muffler hits .  My MotherInLaw broke her foot getting off the bottom step of the deck into the ravine caused by the water running off the Town Road . They have been putting  gravel down from the Rd .  to the steps but it keeps washing into the back yard .  When the house was built it was up to grade .  They said we need to get it up to grade again but it will only wash out again due to the Town Rd .  They do not want to fix it .   Is  the Town responsible to fix this problem ?  Wow thats a tough one .  Id say that the town is responsible since they are the cause of the big mess but then again it IS the state of MA and they will do anything to get around a legal loophole .  I know my dad used to work for the state Id say check with the city hall and see what they say .  If that doesnt help maybe think about getting a lawyer involved .  Either way I wish you lots of luck  ,9

Why is yawning addictive ?  If your in a group and one person starts yawning why do others also start to yawn ?  Yawning Everyone knows that we yawn more and for longer when were bored .  Thats one of the reasons its so embarrassing .  Males who are bored tend to have longer yawns than bored females .  And most people assume that we do it because our bodies need more oxygen .  That sounds sensible doesnt it ?  After all when were bored or tired we breathe more slowly so less air goes through the lungs so the brain signals the lungs to take a deep breath and so we yawn .  The trouble is even breathing enriched air or exercising so that we breathe faster makes no difference to how often we yawn .  We dont yawn because we need more air . We can all agree on what a yawn is like though .  Its a very deep breath taken with the mouth round and wide open .  It ventilates all parts of the lungs something which doesnt happen with normal quiet breathing .  The mouth opens fairly slowly closing more swiftly .  Theres usually a visible swelling of the throat our eyes close and we lower our brows .  Lots of animals appear to yawn but many of the simpler creatures merely gape  opening the mouth wide and not taking a deep breath .  Most mammals yawn just like us though .  Scientists have tried hard to classify human yawns but actually they all look the same .  The only thing that changes is when we do it There seems to be only two basic types the social yawn and the wakeup yawn which just seems part of our general stretching routine .  And just like stretching yawning is a reflex .  It even occurs in animals that have been born without a correctly formed brain .  But normally its triggered by stimuli like tiredness the sight of others yawning or social stress .  Yawning increases blood pressure and heart rate and also flexes muscles and joints .  If you try to stifle or prevent it by clenching your jaws shut a yawn is somehow less satisfying .  For some reason the stretching of jaw and face muscles is necessary .  Yawning seems to keep the brain aroused in situations where sleep is unwanted like in the early morning and when struggling to stay awake at night .  Its associated with high states of alertness  and stress or fear .  At athletics events you sometimes find participants in the race of their lives standing in the starting block and yawning .  Or musicians as they psych themselves up before a concert . All yawns seem to last about six seconds and are very difficult to stop once they get going .  They really are infectious  its not just a coincidence .  Studies have shown that forty to sixty percent of people who see a yawn end up by joining in .  Yawning can be extraordinarily catching .  Hearing one can trigger a yawn .  Even sitting alone in a room thinking or reading about one can cause a yawn . We have a brain mechanism that detects a yawning face  even in our imagination  and which then triggers the same behaviour .  Once the neurological machinery in our head gets underway its hard to stop .  But why ?  It seems that contagious yawning is caused by something very important to humans empathy the ability to identify with other peoples feelings .  People who are particularly prone to contagious yawning also tend to score highly on tests that measure levels of empathy .  They are people who are intune with what others may be feeling and contagious yawning suggests that theyre inclined in certain situations to unconsciously mimic their behaviour .  They tend to be the same people who say ouch when someone else stubs a toe or steps on a sharp object . This ability to feel empathy for others is an important part of being human .  It only develops when we are a year or so old  just like contagious yawning  and no animals show any signs of empathy whatsoever except chimpanzees and orangutans .  It is a definite advantage to us as a species binding social groups together through their feelings for one another and bringing individuals closer together . Some schizophrenics are unabl ,2
How can I find the Help that I need ?  if you look at the article you can see it was cold blooded murder district attorney david yocom made a big mistake he isleaving office soon i would like him to pay for his mistake before he leaves office how many mistakes has this man made i believe in my heart my own attorney was working against me in my sons death case my family needs help they also have false charges on me right now and i think the district attorneys office is falsely accusing me of crimes cause i am making such a big deal out of my sons death my family has been through enough please call me earl smith 801349 6179 We are all little people without the power to effect the kinds of changes you are proposing .   I would suggest that you take each issue one step at a time .   First of all forget the district attorney .   What you would like to see happen will consume all your time and energy .   Put that behind you .   Just remember what goes around comes around . The fact that you have charges against you seems to be the most critical of all .   There is no way to avoid this so you must have representation that you can trust and who will work for your best interests .   Know that attorneys in general take too many cases have too many clients let things go unintentionally and clients are hurt .   The system is flawed right now .   So dont quit .   Keep looking till you find the right one who really will help you .  ,9

disability rights gone to far ?  ladiesyour in the restroom line and a lady in a wheelchair comes into the bathroomis she entiled to jump the line and go before anyone elsei mean if the handicapped stall is not being used then i say sure go aheadbut if its notshouldnt they wait in line like all of us ? im not being mean or insensitivei want viewsits a recent experience i had .  I asked this question a while back .   Most people thought that a person using a wheelchair should be able to go directly to the stall for that purpose since it may require them extra time to use the restroom .   Yes they get to bypass the line . If there are no wheelchair users in line everyone should be entitled to use that stall just like all the others .  ,0

Why does starship interprise have such a rediculous design ?  Its outer hull design is impracticalnon functionalflimsyand full of design weaknesses while the Romulan warbird and the Klingon battle cruiser are more sleek intimidatingimpressiveand practical . If starfleet protects planet earth then how can we not worry ? Are we safe ?  Is anyone else worried ?  lets look at this .. outer hull design is impractical and non functional ? humm gotta differ with you on this the ORIGINAL enterprise NCC1701 is very practical The crew is housed in the saucer section which gives max area inside while maintaining minimum outer surface area and material very practical The saucer section is away from the secondary hull which contains most of the equipment power recyling and the warp engines .  This means it can separate from it in emergencies and people are away from any dangerous padiation leaks if they occur . I would call that functionalflimsy ?  well being in space there is no need for aerodynamics a brick wall would fly just as well as an arrow .  So I dont see your point there . full of design weaknesses ?  ok how about you name some ? How about some of the reasons it was designed that way .  The saucer is made so that the entire bridge can be swapped out for a new bridge depending on the mission .  As can the weapons systems on the lower side of the saucer .  This means it is easily upgraded a good desing feature The engines on the naucells are made to be upgraded and exchanged without having to disassemble the ship we saw this happen severl times throughout the series would you not call this practical and functional If some of the ship were too far damaged the other parts are made to be easily placed on newer parts . all of this sounds nothing like a design flaw to me . As for the romulan and klingon designs well we saw them blow up alot so I would have to say they had some major weaknesses . Abby where did you get that the klingon ships have only one engine ?  they have two one on each side like the bird of prey .  Are you referring to the rear photon torpedo tube below the impulse engines ,1
Can someone please tell me the exact procedure for participating in the Olympics ?  Do you have to be part of a team in your country or can individuals sign up ?   And how can you sign up ?  For the most part you are representing a country so you have to be a citizen of that country .   From what I know to make an Olympic team as a participant on a team sport like basketball or hockey you are invited to tryouts and the coaches choose from that group who go to the Olympics .   For individual sports such as track and field skiing figure skating and others there are Olympic trials where the top two or three finishers in each event make the team .  ,5

Many proms are black tie events . A white tie event would be more like a gala event like going to the Oscars or something like that .  ,0
Atheists  Christians do you think both of you groups made enough investigation whether there is God or not ?  Now it seems every person is obstinate about his beliefs and none seem to have made enough investigation about the issue of the existence of God ? Christians what prove do you have that there is a God without to quote scriptures of the bible ?  Those who do not believe can also reason with scripture . Quoting of scripture will not necessarily convince people to give up their unbelief in God . Atheistssay what makes you think there is no God without to talk about books you read or what any evolution book says ?  Not to be rude but some of you base your aguement on what they taught you at school and not what you yourself have discovered . What does everyone say about the fact that there is so much unfairness on earth ?  What causes many people to kill lie not forgive war etc .? What does everyone say about the scientific calculations that suggest that there is no God ?  Dinosaurs age of earth etc ? Please both groups must not be rude .

Refs gone bad ?  Anyone else think the standard of refeering in the WC is terrible ? Ok make a few refs have done ok but ive seen most of the games and think the majority have been awful .  Could it be too much pressure on them from Fifa ?  or are too many of them just not used to refing big games ? I think TV replays would help for important decisions i . e penaltys and whether the ball has crossed the line . Also players should be punished after the game for diving if they win a penalty or get someone sent off .  The portuguese are very good at this .  I think that the problem is that players are diving and cheating a lot more than ever before so it is much harder on referees .  However some referees seem to just enjoy handing out yellow and red cards and these do often spoil games .  Referees need to be advised as to when someone is diving both by their assistants and through ear pieces an this should reduce the amount of cheating and wrong decisions in the game .  ,5

i have an exam also tomorrow on disfunctions of the ear to can any 1 help with that also gonarrea the sti std I can tell you this much anyone who gets gonorrhea more than once certainly must have a hearing problem and possibly a mental problem also because they should have listened when the person at the Health Department told them to use CONDOMSHeres a good field trip for you go down to your local family planning clinic or Health Dept .  where they treat people who suspect they may have an STD sexually transmitted disease .  Interview some of the staff if they have time to talk to you .   Find out as a person on the spot how the exam and the process goes and you can probably also pick up some good pahphletts or sheets of information about the various sexually transmitted diseases and the tests and treatments  The local Health Department can direct you to the proper place because they are in the STD businessSo not funny  This little field trip may help save your life and give you a new perspective on why it is so important to be careful with all things sexual even oral contact .   When they test most people for Gonorrhea they also do throat swabs too because they often find that a person who is infected in their genitals may also be infected in their throats sometimes only infected in their throats because they consider oral contact to be harmlessDysfunctions of the ear I guess you could have infections wax build up difficulties with hearing certain sounds ringing or what is called Tinnitus of the ear or progressive hearing loss associated with age or noise exposure .  Honestly the ear and STDs are very far apart from where I sit .   Unless the ear could be affected from a Gonorreal infection of the throat or something ?    I think next time you should give us more than one day of notice on your exam subjects .  I have been known to tutor when I was in HS and University but I need a bit of notice since neither of these is my particular area of expertise .  In these days and times I think everyone should be well informed on the subject of STDs The more you know and the smarter you are with your own sexual practices the better your chances are for living a long healthy and happy life Good luck with the test ,1

What does deontological mean ?  In ethics deontological ethics or deontology Greek Deon meaning obligation or duty is a theory holding that decisions should be made solely or primarily by considering ones duties and the rights of others .  Deontology posits the existence of a priori moral obligations further suggesting that people ought to live by a set of defined principles that do not change merely as a result of a change in circumstances ie .  situational ethics . One of the most important implications of deontology is that praiseworthy goals can never justify immoral actions in contrast to doctrines that claim the ends justify the means .  Deontology is directly in opposition to consequentialism an ethical theory in which the ends can justify the means because decisions are judged primarily in terms of their consequences .  ,1

There once was a man who had three weiners and his pants fit him like a glove but thats another story ... OK seriously whats wrong with morning wood ?   Nothing says IM ALIVE like sporting a fullon chubby .   You should embrace your manhood rather than run from it . As for the Hairloss problem talk to your Doctor about going on Propecia .   Must be prescribed but for most people It really works .   The sooner you start taking it the less hair you will lose .   But understand that it is not cheap and if you ever stop taking it your hair will start falling out again .  ,2

How long will my mouth hurt after root canal ?  I had to go to the dentist this morning because I had toothache he said the tooth was badly decayed and he had to do a root canal on it .  The local anaesthetic has worn off now and its quite painful  not like the terrible toothache I had before more of a dull achey pain .  I know its probably just because of the work that was done on the tooth but how long should I expect it to last for ?  And can I take pain killers for it ?  Whats best to take ?  Call him back and tell him youre in pain .   He should have prescribed something in the first place .   My dentist gave me 800mg Motrin which is basically superstrength Advil .   Itll be achy for 23 days .   He should have instructed you to call him back if it still hurts after a week .   Seriously medical care has dwindled in the last 10 years .

Do you think england is going to win the world cup ?  If you look at the rating on a lot of websites soccernet . com included England is rated second best to lift this cup .  And like i have said in the history of this competition only in 1958  1962 did Brazil take it consecutively it has never happened again after then  and i dont expect it to happen again now .  If history repeats itself then its Europes turn to take the cup and England is favorite to lift it among the European teams so i think they can win it .  ,5

My best friend of Seven Years Just stopped talking to me ?  We have been close friends talked about everything and anything .  We both were single moms hanging out taking our kids every where together they were extremely close .  Then she decided to hook me up with her brother so were dating and all hanging out and then she started saying things like I dont think he wants me and the kids around I tried to tell her it wasnt like that .  Now we havent talked in months .  I asked her brother to take care of this because I feel like it wasnt me what should I do ?  any suggestions Try talking to her and finding out the real reason she hasnt been hanging around .   Youre right it probably has nothing to do with you .   It sounds like shes jealous of the time that you and her brother spend together and feels left out .   Try to include her more and set aside special time for you and her .   So many people neglect their friends for a relationship and it should never be like that .   She may be jealous that you found someone and shes still single .   The only way to find out is to talk to her and keep trying to talk to her .   If your kids are close and you and her brother have a future youre going to be in her life for awhile whether she likes it or not and hopefully you can find a way to peacefully coexist .  ,8

Does anyone who how to choose the shoe size for adidas football soccer boots ???  wel im thinking of buying a F50 . 6 or a predictor absolute ...  but i dont know how to choose my size ..  becoz when i want the correct length it is bout uk8 . 5 butits bit unconfotable on the sides .  so i change to uk 9 . 5 but now this time there is bout 1 . 5 cm emptyspase in the fron of the boots ...  which one should i buy ...  also can u reconment me which soccer boots is best to buy now ... there is only pumanikeadidasumbro roun my place ..  Why dont you try a 9 . 0 then ?  Boots must ALWAYS be comfortable no matter what .  So dont ever get the 8 . 5 and if youre growing pretty fast you might want to get the 9 . 5 otherwise dont . As for boots it depends on the type of surface you are playing on i . e .  court field or turf as well as what you need your boots to do for you .  Remember your boots serve you so choose one that serves your needs .  For instance if youre the playmaker and need to spray the passes then go for a pair that allows maximum grip and control . I havent been keeping in touch with the latest boots so I guess you might want to go get a pair with a more experienced buyer .  ,5
My boys have what our dr said was eczema .?  they have it on their hands and feet .  they get what look like blisters they pop open and dry up .  it can be very itchy .  What do you think it is or does anyone have similar symptoms ?   what is best to treat this ?  There are several types of eczema .  I have the type you describe on your sons hands and feet .  Moisturize at least twice a day with a nonscented cream not lotion like Eucerin or Cetaphil or a generic equivalent . Provide them with a mild cleansing bar such as Dove sensitive for bathing and hand washing .  Most people with eczema are very sensitive to chemicals so apply their sunscreen and such yourself avoiding the areas with eczema .  They should avoid exposing the affected areas to very hot water as it makes the itch unbearable . Childrens Benadryl orally can help with severe itching and eczema can cause really severe itching but it may make them sleepy .  Running cool water over the affected area helps a lot .  I have not found that topical Benadryl creams help much .  Aveeno oatmeal products are highly recommended but they dont help me .  Theyre worth a try though .  Actually the cool water helps more than anything but it stops working when the area warms up again . Over the counter cortisone creams may treat the rash but their doc may need to prescribe something stronger .  And Im not sure theyre recommended for children .  They shouldnt wash dishes without gloves or mess around in other chemicals when they are having a flare up . Many kids outgrow eczema .  Unfortunately we dont all poutEDITI almost forgot Sunshine not too much of course helps many eczema sufferers .  Expose the affected area for 1015 minutes a day .  Im kinda weird about getting too hot but many people get quite a bit of relief from sunshine .  Again its worth a try .  ,2
how do i get my picture id if the rmv registry of motor vehicleis giving me such a hard time ?  the reason why i waited soo long to get my id was because i moved out from my parents since i was 16 .  i try going to the rmv to get it at the time but they needed a certified birth certificate .  i didnt have one at the time .  i had the one given to at birth .  im a u . s citizen  since they were giving me such a hard time then i gave up .  now 4 years later i wanted to go back and get my license but yet they were still giving me a hard time . the law change cuz of all the immigration system so i said fine im trying to get a picture id .  they wanted for forms of id i  finally had my certified birth certificate my s . s as well as my bill but the one thing i didnt have is a signature .  what should i do ???  i mess up everything for my self .  They arent giving you a hard time .   They have specific requirements that are probably spelled out in many of their publications and everyone applying for a licensephoto ID needs to abide by the same rules .   Do you have a Voter Registration card ?   Are you 18 at least ?   Register to vote .   Its a free process and you sign your card and it is proof of residency .   You can pick up a Voter Registration application at most US Post Offices libraries or contact the voter registration office in your town . You might think about applying for a US Passport .   You submit your passport application along with a copy of your birth certificate and 2 identical photographs .   A passport is a very valid form of ID and can give you that proof you need to get other forms of ID .   You will need 2 forms of ID when you are hired for jobs in the US too .   Last time I had my passport renewed it was about 50 and it is good for 10 years but it can be used for ID even after it expires .   You can pick up a passport application at many Post Office locations or the process is probably available online by now .  ,9

Can I get a prosecutor fired for being unprofessional and not acting p . c .?  I had to go to court today and got some unfortuate news which at was not as bad as I thought .  I got pulled over last December because I wasnt wearing a seat belt hello I was going through a check point Shouldnt they be worried about drunks ?  And I was late paying my car insurance by three weeks and my insurance company called the bmv and told them I was late so they suspended my licsense I renewed my licsense that night and went downtown and paid a 200 reinstatement fee then I went to court and  paid 260 in court costs .  As far as I knew I had my liscense back and everything was cool .  Then in March I was really upset because a family member owed me money and he said he would bring it over never came over and wasnt picking up his phone .  Furious I drove to his house and was going about 65 in a 40 on an inconspicous country road .  A cop coming the oppisite direction sees me and turns around and pulls me over .  He comes back and tells me my licsense is suspended I guess even contact the board of attorneys you could explain your case and even get his license revoked .   I would call info to get the number since it varies per state ,9

Why does the DEA and AMA allow tobacco companies to continue to put nicotine in cigarettes ?  Its obvious and has been for years that the most lethally addicting substance available is cigarettes .   But tobacco doesnt have any addicting ingredients cigarette companies ADD nicotine to get consumers addicted .   Why in the world is there a war on drugs when the most heinous drug is allowed everywhere ?  Because the government can profit from tobacco sales and people want to smoke regardless of the health effects .  The war on some drugs is just a repeat of prohibition .  Its never going to succeed .  ,9

Didnt Old People Love too ?  I read a question from a teenager who wrote that older people didnt understand what it was to be in love even if you were young .   Im wondering .... how does that young man think he got here ?   So many of the posts about love from teens revolve around sex unfortunately .   Im ready to hear from some folks like me who have been married FIRST then had children and what they taught their children about the difference between love and sex .   I look forward to reading the posts .   Thanks .  Well teens think they know everythingbut they dont have a clue as Im sure you know . Im 40 now divorced w 2 great kids . There is a difference between Love  sex . Also there is a difference between sex  making Love . Sex is just physical . Making Love is intimate  emotional . For those who havent experienced that I feel sorry for you . Thats what Im teaching my kidsbut unfortunately it seems most parents today arent .  ,8

Pumping CO2 into the bottom of the ocean to reduce this green house gas .  Is this method a really ood idea ?  Visit this website for the article  4 years ago I worked on carbon sequestration projects in Australia and internationally .  This included researching biological geological and ocean sequestration of CO2 .  There are pros and cons of all these processes but I see many more pros .   You only have to look at Statoils Sleipner Project in Norway  They have been sequestering CO2 into high saline aquifers since 1996 . They have in fact stopped 1 million tonnes of CO2 from entering the atmosphere per year the equivalent emissions of a 150MW  coal fired power plant in the US . I think it is a great solution until we can move towards a hydrogen economy .  ,1

For gay parents ?  Dont you think if you saw your own dad or mom making out with some one of the same sex as a kid that would mess you up mentally .  Wouldnt it give your kid a unfair bias towards being gay seeing how they observed their parent their role model doing it ?  my moms are lesbien ..  I found out the hard way .   When I was 8 years old after my mom and dad got divorced I was walking to my room it went past my moms room ..  and I saw her and a women flirting with eachother in a weird way ..  like touching and stuff I just starred for a little bit then they started kissing ...  I went to my room and started crying ..  and it was really depressing ..  Ive never been the same .   But Ive just come to the conclusion that I have to deal with it .   I cant change my moms sexual preference ..  and I actually think her girlfriend is really nice .   At first I hated her because I thought she was the one that turned my mom into a lesbien and ruined my life ..  but later on I found out that it was my moms choice .   She wanted to be a lesbien .   I only want whats best for her because I know before this she had a very hard life .   But this still doesnt make ME normal ..  I get teased a lot at school ..  and sometimes I really wish I had a normal life .   I hope this helped you  and my moms dont make out in front of me ...  and I am not a lesbien .   theyve raised me to be straight ,8

Anyone know details of refugee status in the US and how it works ?  My boyfriend is from Sudan and has refugee status in the US because of the war there .  He can work and go to school here legally and hes been here for 3 and a half years .  Right now hes on his first trip back home since he came to the states ...  sort of a family emergency .  He should be home in about 6 weeks . Anyway what Im wondering is whether anyone knows the fine details about refugee status .  Does it expire ?  If so when ?  How is the time determined ?  Once youre a refugee can you eventually be deported if you dont become an actual citizen within a certain amount of time ? I would ask my bf about this stuff but obviously he isnt here right now .  No one Ive asked so far has any clue ...  so maybe someone here will .  Heres hoping ...  P . S .   Ive asked this before and got people saying hes on vacation and using me .   Thats not the case at all but Im just stating in advance since I learned from before Im not asking for your relationship advice .   Thats not the Q ?   According to the information under refugee status at the www . uscis . gov site  a refugee is ... Under U . S .  law a refugee is a person who has fled his or her country of origin because of past persecution or a wellfounded fear of persecution based upon race religion nationality political opinion or a membership in a particular social group .  If the person is not in the United States he or she may apply overseas for inclusion within the U . S .  refugee program .  If the person is already within the United States he or she may apply for the U . S .  asylum program . Your boyfriend probably applied for refugee status while living in Kenya as a refugee from the war in Sudan .  Since it sounds from your comments like most of his family is in Kenya and that is where he has spent most of the time he may very likely not have any changes in his status .  Per the USCIS site ..... Generally refugees must be outside their homelands to be eligible for the U . S .  refugee program though the U . S .  processes application from refugees in their home countries in a few places .  currently the U . S .  has such programs in Cuba Vietnam and the former Soviet Union .    I think that a lot of the Cuban nationals living in the US under refugee or asylum categories do not naturalize but do live here as legal alien residents .   .   If your boyfriend has refugee status and also has school and work permits then he has must also have temporary residency status under the label of refugee .  I dont think that acquiring US citizenship is a necessity or requirement .  In fact on that same site there is a section listing the steps and requirements for anAsylee or Refugee Seeking Lawful Permanent Residence Form I485 .  There is also a processing timetable available .   Also regarding his ability to travel home for family emergency he hopefully filed a form I131 Application for Travel Document . Per the USCIS site While your I485 is pending you are permitted to travel outside the U . S .  however you must have a valid Refugee Travel Document to reenter the country .  You can apply for a refugee travel document by filing Form I131 Application for Travel Document .  Due to new security procedures allow 150 days prior to beginning travel to obtain a travel document .   Hope you find this helpful .  ,9

Why would anyone say our soldiers died for nothing ?  They have given their lives for others freedom .  That to me is everything .  Anyone who knows me knows to never ever say anything derogatory about these young men and women in my presence regardless of how they feel about the war .  They are my brothers and sisters .  Yes there have been abuses and errors and those need to be investigated and any violators appropriately punished .  But by far the vast majority of our military personnel are professional dedicated and just .  Everyone dies eventually but some get to die fighting for something in which they believe .  To detract from this honorable death by saying they died for nothing is IMHO virtually unforgiveable .  Does the person who dies in a hospital bed from some incurable disease die for nothing ?  ,9

Does Pete Rose belong in the HOF ?  I grew up in Queens the Shea Stadium neighborhood .  So I often got a chance to see Pete Rose play in the late 60s early 70s .  Never saw a ballplayer who hustled with such intensity as Pete Rose .  On a routine ground ball he would sprint with all of his heart to first base .  If he thought the play would be close he would dive head first to try to beat the throw .  He was a geniune ballplayer all heart and a gifted batting eye .  Thats why he holds the record for most career hits breaking Ty Cobbs record .  Needless to say he belongs in the hall of fame .  And hes probably better than 75 percent of the inductees . All I have to say about that is the steroid issue now permeating baseball is a greater crime than Pete Rose betting on baseball games not involving his team .  Bart Giamonti baseball commissioner who banned Rose was too full of himself .  No where near as great as Rose was to baseball .  Let him in and we should all beg for his forgiveness .  ,5

Is there some sort of animal where the babies hatch out of holes in the mothers back ?   Maybe a fish or frog ?  I have this weird memory that Ive watched a nature special about it but Ive searched and googled and cant find anything like it .  Frogs and toads display some of the most amazingly varied breeding behaviors and mechanisms The Surinam toad Pipa pipa is an aquatic species in which the eggs after being fertilized during a complex courtship  are placed with the aid of the male on the back of the female embedded in the skin .  The eggs do not undergo indirect developmet as in most frogs they dont hatch as tadpoles instead after 35 months they emerge as young juvenile frogs .  More Information from Animal Diversity Web addition there are some frogs in South America known as marsupial frogs .  These are tree frogs in which the female has a dorsal pouch of skin on her back and the eggs develop inside this pouch .  After hatching they come out of the pouch opening that opens posterodorsally .  This is what the female with the eggs looks like theres another amazing frog here in Argentina the tiny green Darwin frog that lives in the southwestern forests .  In this species the male takes the eggs after theyve been fertilized and puts them in his vocal sacs the pouches at his throat that he uses to produce sounds .  They stay in the vocal sacs until theyre more developed and can come out and go on growing by themselves .  know this has nothing to do with the question but I think these are so interesting  ,1

what do you think of george bush and the job he has done on the war on terrorism ?  i am wondering how many people actually think they could do a better job the bush i personally feel that everyone beats on him but they dont really understand how hard it would be to run a country full of arrogant selfcentered people plus dealing with countries that are trying to take over this free country and take all of our freedom away .  I am a Canadian but I think President Bush is doing a good job  but I do believe he should have taken his time and got rid of Osama before he went into Iraq  but it is done .

I am Pagan what are Christians so afraid of ?  Or is it just ignorance that causes this animosity .?  People tend to fear that which they do not understand or which challenges their preconcieved notions about their world .  This is particularly true for those who are insecure in their avowed beliefs which are actually nothing more than inherited beliefs from their parents .  The unexamined faith is actually no faith at all .  Its almost axiomatic that the more insecure people are in their own faith the more hostile they are to the faiths of others . Thats why they seem to be afraid of you and why they seem antagonistic you call into question beliefs about which they themselves are insecure .  ,0
our daughter will not talk to her teachers or any one other than family members she will talk to other kids ?  Heres an article from TIME Magazine that should provide some comfort and ideas for youWhy Abby Cant TalkShe has a condition called selective mutism that is neither as rare nor as hopeless as experts believed .  But the right help is hard to find .  Abby Barnes hand shoots up nearly every time her teacher asks the 19 squirmy firstgraders in her suburban Philadelphia public school to match letters of the alphabet to the sounds they make .  Sitting up front with her pinchable cheeks framed by long blond hair Abby 7 looks as eager as any of her classmates to blurt out an answer .  But every time the teacher calls on her Abby freezes .  Her face tightens .  She strains to respond .  And even if an answer manages to get past her lips her words are inaudible .  Shes effectively mute throughout the school dayeven at recess where the closest she will come to open communication is words whispered to a trusted girlfriend . At home however Abby is a different child .  She loves to play cards and board games and frolic with her brother Jack 5 .  She speaks loudlysometimes too loudlyand can be bossy toward her brother says mother Lisa Barnes who runs the trading desk at a moneymanagement firm .  Abby is in every other way a perfectly normal child who has no shortage of extracurricular activities including horsebackriding lessons and dance classes that shes been attending since she was 4 .  Performing in public is fine says her mother .  She likes people to look at her and applaud . So why doesnt she speak up in class ?  What may at first glance look like shyness or obstinacy is actually something far more complexand much more interesting .  Abby like hundreds of thousands of kids across the U . S .  is suffering from a little understood but increasingly recognized childhood disorder called selective mutism . The key to selective mutism or SM for short is the seemingly incongruous behavior Abby exhibits voluble in private silent in public .  According to the official psychiatric diagnostic manual DSMIV a child who has developed normally at home but has not talked at school or in other social situations for at least a month is a strong candidate for a diagnosis of SM .  Experts once believed that fewer than 1 in 1000 kids developed the disorder but an influential study three years ago in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry put the prevalence at closer to 7 in 1000 making SM almost twice as common as autism . SM can strike at any age even among children who once talked in public but it usually becomes obvious by age 3 or 4 when peers are happily jabbering away .  About 30 of kids with SM also have a developmental speech impairment which can exacerbate the problem but is generally not the cause .  In the past doctors often recommended speech therapy but treating the physical or neurological issues alone will probably have little impact on the underlying psychological factors behind SM . The root of the problem in most cases is an extreme form of social anxiety or phobia .  It is a fear that can literally make it impossible to speak says Dr .  Elisa ShiponBlum a Philadelphiabased clinician who specializes in treating selective mutism .  As with most social anxieties SM is more common in girls and is believed to have a strong genetic component .  About 70 of kids with SM have an immediate family member who also struggles with social anxiety . Compared with childhood disorders in which children are disruptive and disorderly such as attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder ADHDselective mutism gets less attention and considerably fewer research dollars .  These children are ignored because lets face it they arent causing anyone trouble .  They are literally left alone and forgotten about says psychologist Lindsey Bergman associate director of the UCLA child and adolescent OCD obsessiv ,3

im emily i need to know if prenatal vitamins will make my breasts bigger so i can breast feed my baby when it Prenatal vitamins will not make your breasts bigger . The pregnancy hormones will make your breasts tender and sore and as you near the birth of your child the breasts will swell with milk . But prenatal vitamins have absolutely nothing to do with it .  They are just large doses of the vitamins and minerals that your body needs because the baby is leeching what it needs to thrive and grow .  ,2
easement of property  our gas line goes over neighbors yard  help answer question on easement rights ?  we have a gas line that goes about 50  yards into the neighbors yard  there is no easement listed in the county for his property or mine with each other or utility companies .  Is our title valid ?  should we have not known about the gas line and it being in the neighbors yard ?  There is such a thing as an implied easement for utilities .   Almost certainly thats what your state allows .   In order to let ulitlity companies provide service throughout their territory they get automatic easement rights to string wires lay pipeline and such .   Yes your title is valid .   And when you think about it you will see that your property is more valuable for having the gas service than it would be if no gas line were there .   So you or a future buyer is not damaged by the gas line which would be a major consideration in any title suit . Good luck and dont worry .  ,6

Funny Question But could be proved in three different ways that I know of ......?  When I told my grandpa that I am gonna divide 25 of the property shares amongst 5 of us brothers getting each of us 15th of the property he said I am cheating him ....  15th ie .  if we divide 25 with 5 of 25 is not 5 but 14 Though it was a shock to me as I was thinking so far that I am very good in maths but the possibility of getting the answer he said gave a new direction to me though I know it is wrong ....  So my good friends why dont you try dividing 25 with 5 and get the result 14 ?  25  ? 14 x 15  120140 . 05  280 ??? Sorry but what the hell are you on about ????  ,1

can any one tell me why blood didnt clot in heart ?  why the blood didnt clot in the heart .  consider if i am got hurt in the hand then that time the blood will flows since the atomosphere air is to make that to clot .....  BUT WHY THE BLOOD IN THE HEART IS NOT AT ALL CLOTED ALTHOUGH THE AIR THAT WE BREATH IS THE SAME ATMOSPHERE A very interesting question really . Firstly we need to look at what causes the blood clot .   The answer lies in the platelet .   An irregularly shaped colorless body that is present in the blood .   It survives for 710 days before being broken down in the liverspleen by phagocytes .   Indeed blood clots when it is exposed to air .   The body has amazingly found a loophole in blood being exposed to air for the 2 conditions  This loophole lies in the loss of blood .   If the body detects a loss of blood and the presence of air at the same time the platelets immediately kick into action .   The tiny platelets immediately rush to the wound form a layer scab by bursting and spilling its contents .   Its contents along with calcium the vitamin K and a protein fibrinogen forms a clot .   All these components forms a clot by first forming fibrin .   These fibrin are actually tiny threads which later form a wirelike mesh .   This mesh help to hold the red blood cells inside the body .   This explains why our scab is red initially but turn brown such is the color of our blood .  ,1

I am trying to get along  with my fiance but I dont know how to settle our difference .?  Well we like different things .  We have nothing in comment but we are tired of dating different peolpe .  We just wanted to settle down but now it seems like things are changing .  I tried to see the positive side of things and he sees the negative side .  I feel like I am no good for him .  Know he dont want to spend time with me .  First off I am sorry you are in that situation .   I was too and I did marry that guy .   I do love my husband but we still dont get along any better .  We were forced into marriage because I was pregnant and I had just left an abusive realtionship and wanted a steady thing .   Dont settle with someone just to settle down .   Sure the idea of a husband is nice but what is the point if you cant get along ?   Your happiness is of the utmost importance .   You need to sit down and have a talk with him about your feelings he at least deserves that .  He may feel the same way .  Good Luck ,8

What do you think of this situation i read it and i didnt agree with the outcome ...?  I cant remember word for word the story .   A man driving down a road almost hit a little girl that ran into the street .   The man stopped and got out of his car and went over to talk to the girl .   He basically was telling her not to run into the street because she could get hit but he had put his hand on her shoulder much like you would when you talk to your own kids about something .   The parents called the cops on him because he had put his hand on the girls shoulder while he talked to her .   He was arrested and was not convicted but was made to register as a sex offender .   Do you think this outcome was the correct thing ?   What should the outcome have been ?  If that is the entire story then that outcome is completely bogus .  There is NOTHING wrong with touching another person on the head shoulder leg back etc .  There is only something wrong when a person touches a bad place which CLEARLY was not happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street .  What should have happened ?  The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter .  The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street .  And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sexcrime crazed society .  There was no need for any trials or arrests .  And how is someone who was NOT CONVICTED ie innocent of a crime forced to register as a sex offender ?  That simply doesnt make any sense at all .  ,9

When the time comes that our Military and our Commander in Chief along with the Iraqi government determine  ..  that Iraq is secure enough and capable of handling its own defenses and our troops are called home .....  Will the Iraq war detractors claim victory in their call to get the troops back now The answer is yes .  Anything the president does from now until the end of his term will be pounced upon by his detractors in an effort to demoralize and discredit .  Anything that happens in Iraq that either is negative or can be spun in a negative view likewise . As long we have to deal with the Ted Kennedys and Hillary Clintons of this world people will continue to misunderstand the events going on around them because they will be listening to campaigns of misinformation . One example is the person who answered saying that the American people were told that the war would be over in less than a year .  The truth is that major combat operations were over in far less than a year but then terrorist jihadist antiAmerican insurgents began their campaign of murder and quasiorganized crime such as kidnappings for ransom .  See people listen to the liberal farleft media and other whining sources and come to believe that Bush lied  instead of what really happened which is that he was talking about major operations forceonforce maneuvering at the divisionelement level which really was over in less than a year . The same people who spread the misinformation in the first place will be the first ones to blow the whistle when their nonsense doesnt pan out .  ,9
How I make a character jump fly or float in mid air in a clayanimation film ?  Im making a clayanimation film and I need advice in how to make someone or something jump or fly in the set without any strings or cords appearing in the shot .  In claymation films you use the stopmotion technic to make anything move so how do I do to maintain a character in midair long enough to take a shot at it ?  You could use the old school approach use mono filament line such as superthin clear fishing line .  Experiment with the film angles and lighting to get decent footage where the lines are not visible .  Thats how they did it for decades not only in stop motion but live action films see just about any 1950s GradeB scifihorroralien invasion film to see how NOT to do it where the lines are completely visible Digital editing is a nice idea but it kind of does away with the whole idea of stop motion if you can digitally manipulate the back ground why stop there ?  why not just digitally manipulate all the action as well ?  ,7

I suffer from urticaria and angieodema deep swelling in the tissues .   Can anyone please help me find a cure ?  I am on daily antihisthamine 1 in morning  2 at night but still suffering .   Despite Doctors and Skin Specialists prescriptions no relief .   Have been screened for allergies  non  When the swellings are bad my eyes swell and close up .   My face swells my lips and chin I look like Desperate Dan or Elephant Man .   I Also have to take steriods which reduce the symptoms but do not cure this longterm .   When my throat or tongue swells it isEpiPen injection and off to hospital .   This all began with a bereavement and although many years ago these problems keep recurring with no apparent cause other than stress or tiredness or sometimes nothing at all .   When at their worst cannot go out and face the world has affected my work and I am at the end of my tether .   Please help if you can .  Avoidance of triggersMany patients with urticaria assume that a causative agent can be identified and avoidance of the trigger will cure their ailment .  This may be possible in acute urticaria but unfortunately it is not possible in the majority of chronic urticaria cases because of the idiopathic nature of the condition .  General education about urticaria and avoidance of triggers can help patients understand their condition and come to terms with it .  In general patients should avoid drugs known to either cause or exacerbate hives such as aspirin NSAIDs opiates and ACE inhibitors .  Alcohol should also be avoided .  Acetaminophen may be a substitute treatment to control pain .  Several studies have shown that COX2 inhibitors such as rofecoxib and celecoxib appear to be safely tolerated in these patients78 .  The recent withdrawals of rofecoxib Vioxx and valdecoxib Bextra leave celecoxib Celebrex as the currently available COX2 inhibitor in the United States .  ACE inhibitors should be discontinued in anyone experiencing angioedema .  Can angiotensin II receptor blockers ARBs be used in these patients ?  A recent study10 showed that a small percentage of patients with angioedema that was induced by ACE inhibitor use continued to have symptoms when their treatment was switched to an ARB .  Therefore caution should be exercised16 .  PharmacotherapyPharmacotherapeutic options for urticaria are listed in table 2 .  What is the firstline treatment ?  Antihistamines antihistamines antihistamines Newergeneration H1 antihistamines are generally quite effective in controlling the condition and have a side effect profile of minimal or no sedation and dry mucous membranes .  Firstgeneration antihistamines such as hydroxyzine Atarax Vistaril diphenhydramine hydrochloride and cyproheptadine hydrochloride may be an addon therapy .  Cyproheptadine is the treatment of choice for both cold urticaria and cholinergic urticaria3 .  Taking antihistamines according to a schedule rather than on an asneeded basis is the key to attaining disease control .  Doses may need to be adjusted upward depending on the severity of the disease .  The relative potency of these agents needs to be considered for example 10 mg of cetirizine Zyrtec is about equivalent to 30 mg of hydroxyzine311 .  In a study of the central nervous system effects of higher doses of the nonsedating antihistamine fexofenadine Hindmarch and colleagues17 found that doses of up to 360 mg did not cause psychomotor or cognitive dysfunction .  If symptoms are not optimally controlled with H1 antihistamines addition of an H2 blocker should be considered .  Another option is to add doxepin hydrochloride Sinequan a tricyclic antidepressant with potent H1 and H2 antihistamine properties and strong antipruritic action .  Unfortunately the severe sedation and dry mouth associated with this medication tend to limit its use .  Leukotriene receptor blockers used as addon therapy to H1 antihistamines have been shown to provide some benefit1819 .  However as solo therapy they have not been found to be effective20 .  Glucocorticoids are generally not necessary and should be avoided if possible because of their associated side effects and the tendency for lesions to recur after discontinuation of these drugs .  What are the options for patients with severe unremitting urticaria who have had poor response to standard therapy ?  To ensure that the diagnosis is correct a biopsy and a referral to an allergist should be considered .  Nonstandard therapy such as cyclosporine Gengraf Neoral Sandimmune has been used with some effectiveness21 .  Other nonstandard therapies include intravenous immunoglobulin plasmapheresis methotrexate Rheumatrex Trexall colchicine dapsone sulfasalazine Azulfidine hydroxychloroquine sulfate Plaquenil and warfarin sodium Coumadin21 .  Management of angioedemaManagement of angioedema is more difficult than t ,2

Why does the gay community have such a strong dislike for bisexual people ?  What if you truly like both sexes just the same ??  Why is that so wrong ?  like other people have stated i dont think that the whole gay community thinks badly of bisexuals .  those who do probably think in black or white male or female gay or straight .  they probably feel that bisexuals are gays who use bisexuality as a way to still be socially acceptible because they can be out with members of the opposite sex and yet in the privacy of their bedrooms are sleeping with members of the same sexthe whole having your cake and eating it too .  they also want to believe that these people are lying to themselves of course it doesnt help when there are a large amounts of married people who are looking for a same sex lover when their husband or wife is away .  and the rise of bichic girlsthe type of girls who make out with each other when at clubsparties on videos such as girls gone wild or the  im 100 straight male until im drunk and horny then whatever is available guys they dont quite paint bisexuals in the best light .  there is nothing wrong with bisexuality love is love no matter who is it with .  the things that make you sexually attracted to a woman is completely different than those that make you attracted to a man .  i think as long as you and your partnerpartners have no problem with your bisexuality then you have no problem at all and never mind those people who dont understand about you straight or gay ,0

do you think people should beat there kids and why ?  No people should not beat their kids .   No one should hit anyone .   Hittiing kids just teaches them that it is ok to try to get your  own way by using violence and that it is ok for a big person to hit a small person .   Hitting a child is assault and anyone who does it should be charged and convicted and go to jail to be hit everyday by someone much bigger than them .  ,3

How do you think the Christian image could be improved ?  Should some Christians stop being negative and judgmental when spreading the good word ?  Should some nonChrisitians stop judging all Christians based on the bad actions of a few ?  What is to be done ?  P . S .   I am not trying to endorse the Christian religion preach to anyone etc .  Just ask this as a generic question .  The Christian image could be improved by Christian families by displaying family values in public such as praying at the table before eating their food in restaurants .   You can tell a Christian by their acts of kindness their acts of non rudeness .   They do not boast about their religion but set a good example of being Christ like .... not like Christ around other people .   They are just darn nice people   When you are looking at a person who is really making you mad picture them as though it were Christs face and then see how you would answer them instead of what you were gonna do or say .   Its dramatically different than what you were thinking at first .   Jesus loves OUR ememies as much as He loves us .   Thats all I can say about it right now .  ,0
is this just me ?  sometimes when i have my eyes close i blink .  but my eye doesnt open up at all not even a little bit .  is this just me ?  and if not why does this happen ?

So you have a build in eyemoistdistributor . The body is a wonderful creation and an amazing design everything has a purpose .

John Wheelers split beam experiment ?  What is the paradox to John Wheelers split beam experiment ?  How is it related to the distant stars and their existence ?  Can someone explain in laymans terms ?  A beam splitter is an optical device that splits a beam of light in two .  It is the crucial part of most interferometers . In its most common form it is a cube made from two triangular glass prisms which are glued together at their base using Canada balsam .  The thickness of the resin layer is adjusted such that for a certain wavelength half of the light incident through one port i . e .  face of the cube is reflected and the other half is transmitted .  Polarizing beam splitters such as the Wollaston prism use birefringent materials splitting light into beams of differing polarization . Another design is the use of a halfsilvered mirror .  This is a plate of glass with a thin coating of aluminum usually deposited from aluminum vapour with the thickness of the aluminum coating such that of light incident at a 45 degree angle one half is transmitted and one half is reflected .  Instead of a metallic coating a dielectric optical coating may be used .  Similarly a very thin pellicle film may also be used as a beam splitter . A third version of the beam splitter is a dichroic mirrored prism assembly which uses dichroic optical coatings to split the incoming light into three beams one each of red green and blue .  Such a device was used in multitube colour television cameras and also in the 3 film Technicolor movie cameras . In Physics the beam splitter is famous for its use in the MichelsonMorley experiment in 1887 .  ,1
what it means when my girlfriend says Ill still love youIll never going to forget youbut I need some time I will always love youyou know that I dobut this is for the bestif in time our paths encounter again well see what happensthis were the last words that I hear from My girlfriend before breaking up  those words gave some hope that probably in time Ill see her again in my lifebut I could be wrong .

how much of a loan could i get with nonestablished credit ?  Based on my experience its probably not that much .  I used to work in a bank and would review loan applications from people with little or no credit history .  Your best bet is to get a cosigner with a good credit history to back the loan with you being the primary applicant but even with this approach you may still only qualify for up to a few thousand or less depending on your current income and other expenses .  Although even starting with just a few thousand it should be a good starting loan to establish some history for you .

A friend of mine is on chemopharapy ?  My Friend is on chemopharapy but her hair on the top of her head is growing faster then the hair at the sides she wants me to ask if there is any style to have her hair in so she can have her long hair when it grows back at the moment it is around 23 inches at the top and 2 . 5 inches at the sides would this make any differnce in growing it She looks foward to your answers as she is to embarrassed to ask people she knows or her local hair dresser . Thanks Honestly having gone through chemo myself the best thing to do is to have it trimmed frequently and use good quality salon only shampoos and conditioners .  Also she should ask her doctor if she can take a vitamin supplement which will help her hair grow when she finishes her therapy .  ,2

How many pins does a computers processor have ?  The number of pins on the package will vary by processor . However by visiting can look up most of the AMD processors .   Youll notethat the AMD processors fit into two packages Socket 754and Socket 940 . The chips which uses Socket 754 have 754 pins andsimilarly the chips which use the Socket 940 hasapproximately 940 pins .   I say approximately becausefor example the AMD Athlon 64X2 DualCore processor onlyimplements 939 pins apparently leaving one unfilled in the940 socket . If you visit the Intel site youll find that many of the Pentiums ie .  Intel Pentium D Processor 840 have 775pins see like the Pentium 4 Processor 478 pins ,4

Are we entering a new Cold War due to the lack of Diplomacy ?  Iran sent President Bush a 17 page letter which President Bush refused to reply to simply because the letter didnt address issues the way The Bush Administration would prefer .   This letter to our President was at least some dialogue which could have opened a door to further communications between Iran and the United States . North Korea is redirected away from diplomacy with the United States and talks are outsourced to other Nations who are supposed to get Americas point across . With out disagreements there would be little need for diplomacy but without diplomacy there will never be agreements .  Yes and if Americans dont find a way to deal with it violence and civil war are just around the corner right here on American soil .  ,9

What is Global warming ?  Does anyone have any proof ?  I dont believe in global warming until I have proof .  I do believe in politics .  Global warming is the observed increase in the average temperature of the Earths atmosphere and oceans in recent decades .    .  It is mostly manmade and comes from everything from factories to cars .   Almost every single real scientific study links global warming directly to humans . Its only certain political figures that dont want to change for reasons easily guessable .  That is why the whole developed world signed that Kyoto Treaty and why every single developed country is working to reduce their polluting of the air water and land .  See the new Gore movie it has the backing of the scientific AND POLITICAL groups Scientific community  GroupsNOAA National Oceanic  Atmospheric Administration on why PeerReviewed Journals are the only real scientific studies to be believed  EPAs site for KIDS  NASA Atmospheric Radiation Measurement ARM Program is an important part of the U . S .  Department of Energys strategy to understand global climate change of the above are  . gov sites . Edit Notice how the person below me offers no evidence whatsoever .   That is exactly what is holding us back in taking real steps in fixing this very easily fixable problem .   All people like this due is try to poke holes in something that is already rocksolid in ALL REAL SCIENTIFIC GOVERNMENT COMMUNITIES .  Hollywood Gore or anyone else who has made this up .   It is our own government organizations working separately that have all come to the same conclusion .   The people who dont believe offer nothing but opinions and fake studies done by nongovernmental  or nonepeer reviews  organizations . It is a real problem that can be fixed with easy measures .  ,9

What insight into eternal life does scripture provide us with ?  To all who believe God there is hope of living forever . What is eternal life going to be like ?   What specific scriptural insights give us a peek at what Gods eternal kingdom will be like ? Please be specific and give chapter and verse to support your answer .  Revelations 2110  He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God 11  having the glory of God .  Her light was like a most precious stone as if it was a jasper stone clear as crystal 12  having a great and high wall having twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written on them which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel .  13  On the east were three gates and on the north three gates and on the south three gates and on the west three gates .  14  The wall of the city had twelve foundations and on them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb .  15  He who spoke with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city its gates and its walls .  16  The city lies foursquare and its length is as great as its breadth .  He measured the city with the reed Twelve thousand twelve stadia .  Its length breadth and height are equal .  17  Its wall is one hundred fortyfour cubits by the measure of a man that is of an angel .  18  The construction of its wall was jasper .  The city was pure gold like pure glass .  19  The foundations of the citys wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones .  The first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third chalcedony the fourth emerald 20  the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolite the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the tenth chrysoprasus the eleventh jacinth and the twelfth amethyst .  21  The twelve gates were twelve pearls .  Each one of the gates was made of one pearl .  The street of the city was pure gold like transparent glass .  22  I saw no temple in it for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple .  23  The city has no need for the sun neither of the moon to shine for the very glory of God illuminated it and its lamp is the Lamb .  ,0

How should I dress for interview with agency ?  I know how I should dress but my problem is that I had a baby in Dec .  and dont fit in any of my decent clothes .  This is an interview with an agency that hires people for jobs and the job is for an accounting position at a car dealership .  I dont have much to spend on clothes ... pretty much nothing to spend and i dont know if what I have is going to look right .   Should I be stressing about this ???  Or just wear the best thing I have ? Stupid question ...... I know You cant go wrong with a simple black or gray suit whether pants or skirt and a crisp white shirt .

How  should i deal with the people around me ? it seems difficult to satisfy people myselfGod all together ?  There is no way that you will ever be able to satisfy 100 of the people 100 of the time .  You have to look at your beliefs and your ethics and values .  Usually listening to the inner voice is a huge key .  One thing that I have learned is to breathe  I know that this sounds silly but it does work .  The fact that you are able to stop your emotional flow to take a minute to focus on inhaling and exhaling allows your logical side to have control even if its just long enough for a breath .  Physically the inhalation of air will feed your brain cells .  You will be less likely to overreact .  You will be happier with yourself if you do take a moment .  You will be able to react in a way more in tune with your beliefs and the difficult person may not be as bothersome . Another thing I have always lived by is LEAPS  L      Listen  E      Empathize  A      Apologize  P      Positive Phrasing  S      SolutionListen  to what the person is saying  sometimes all they need is to say what their issue is . Empathize  No one has a situation that is so far removed from the norm that someone else can not relate to it .  Apologize  Chicago was right  sometimes it really is hard to say Im sorry but it is totally worth it .   And look at it this way even if you are not sorry for what happened you are sorry that it has caused a negative reaction . Positive Phrasing  Quote the Beatles can yall tell I was a music major yet ???   LOL  We can work it out  Every problem has a solution .  It may be that the difficult person and you have no more interaction but it is solved . Solution  Look at the root and discuss an option for solution .  Most problems are not really issues they are lacks of communications .  People dont listen anymore and we as a society have learned to that its not worth the time to communicate because our heart felt emotions fall on deaf ears when we try .   Be committed to listening . I hope this helps  email me and let me knowLeighlee ,0

Does anyone else have emetophobia ?  Do you have any methods of decreasing the fear ?  There are many therapies available today to treat emetophobia . All phobias are symptoms of an anxiety disorder because if you werent frightened you wouldnt have the phobia and you shouldnt be frightened of things that dont pose any risk to you .  The same is true of Emetophobia . So how do you stop the cycle ? Simple ... you defeat the anxiety disorder that causes the nausea and the fear of vomiting emetophobia and therefore you stop the phobia . This works every time but you have to know how to stop the anxiety . Regression Hypnotherapy is one therapy that will allow a person to remember that particular event and review it with adult eyes this time around .  This will then allow them to interpret the event correctly and it will no longer be an issue for themAlternative TherapiesReflexologyFor this your feet and hands are used .  They say that certain points on your hands and feet relate and are linked to certain organs or other parts of your body .  By massaging specific parts of the hands and feet is said to help with digestion headaches solar plexus which should help with anxiety and other parts such as your heart lungs chest etc ... By doing reflexology it may help with your anxiety stress and tension throughout your body . MassageThere are different types of massage which are said to do different things to the body some use aroma some manipulate the muscles and joints but the aim is to make you relax which may help with the anxiety and stress of your phobia . ReikiReiki can help with variety of issues including emotional health depression anxiety physical health personal boundaries and abundance .  The practice of Reiki is based on working with and channelling energy or a spiritual energy .  This energy can be referred to as chi The intention with all these energy techniques is that if you can harmonise your energy system you are putting your body in the best possible position to heal itself on all levels physical mental emotional and spiritual .  A relative of mind is qualified in reiki the treatment involves you lying down comfortably so that you relax .  She then moves her hands around the body no contact is made channelling energy to problem areas or just around the body in general .  Its very relaxing and refreshing .  It helps you clear your mind and helps your body to heal and feel revitalised . ShiatsuThis is similar to acupuncture and reike together but there is no needles involved .  The Shiatsu therapist uses hisher finger to put pressure on your energy channel .  It is said to stimulate the energy channel and maybe get rid of energy blockages that are causing pain or illness . AcupunctureAgain like with reiki and Shiatsu this works with the Chi energy which is said to flow around the body .  Needles are used instead of the fingers and are inserted at certain points of the energy channel which is meant to help with pain relief anxiety and nausea . HypnotherapyThis can be a choice for the treatment of your emetophobia .  It involves lying or sitting and relaxing your muscles until you are completely relaxed .  Once relaxed the therapist then tells your unconscious mind of how and what changes it can make to make your life better .  By using hypnotherapy they may even be able to find the cause of your fear which in theory should help you overcome this .  Its hard to say whether or not hypnotherapy can cure you but it can help you to relax and unwind and maybe even train your mind to cut off from emetophobia . Conventional TherapyCognitiveBehaviour Therapy or CBTThis is usually the first choice of treatments by therapists .   .  It is based on the fact that your phobia creates your anxiety .  Using that theory they aim to help you control your anxiety .  From my experience what they did was to give you small tasks to do which you wouldnt normally do for example walk to the shops if you dont normally go o ,2

whats the most adictive drug ?  Cocaine is the most addictive and most dangerous drug .   It is an alkaloid found in leaves of the South American shrub Erythroxylon coca .  It is a powerfully reinforcing psychostimulant .  The drug induces a sense of exhilaration in the user primarily by blocking the reuptake of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the midbrain .   As a rule of thumb it is EXTREMELY unwise to experiment with cocaine .   Scientists have found that the pleasure receptors in the brain experience ONE HUNDRED TIMES more stimulation when using cocaine than when having an orgasm  Now thats a lot of pleasure  Imagine how addicted you would be if you ever experienced anything like it  Not to mention that it ruins your life because nothing will ever bring you as much joy as it used to now that youve experienced the new high . But yeah the answer to your question is crack cocaine .  ,2
because venus has greater atmospheric co2 content than earth has surface tempruter of venus is  ...?  the surface temperature of venus is 1warmer due to absorption of longwaveinfraredby green house gas 2warmer due to the absorbation of short waves ultraviloteradiation by green house gas It will be warmer due to absorption of longwave infrared by greenhouse gases . Your question could just as easily be worded as How does the greenhouse effect work ?  To see an excellent explanation and illustrations of how greenhouse gases absorb infrared energy go to principle operates the same here on Earth as it does on Venus it is just that Venus has some other effects that have exacerbated the atmospheric content of CO2 along with its much higher atmospheric pressures .  Most of the Russian Venera probes to Venus lasted about an hour on the surface at a temperature of about 850 F .  and pressures equal to about 3000 ft below the sea 90 times earths atmosphere .  ,1

Can biking on uneven terrain be faster than on flat ?  Assume a flat course on which a biker can average 30 kilometers per hour if putting his maximal effort . Now assume the same biker goes on a terrain the same length half way uphill and half way downhill ending in the same location where he started . Could he obtain a better time on the second course ?  Like if he is able to maintain an average of 20 kmh uphill the bike would propel him at more than 45 kmh downhill ?  According to the conservation of energy your answer is negative .  The effort that biker put in each case is consumed to resist both the friction and the work needed against gravity .  On flat path no vertical work is made so his energy name it E is totally consumed for resisting friction f against movement of him M and his bike m along the path LEMmgfLNow suppose a terrain path LL which is surely longer than the straight one L which have a max vertical difference of H .  The work he must do to move to the top is MmgH plus the work needed against alongside friction .  The energy will change back to kinetic form during descend session and therefore cancels the initial effort put .  The only work that is to be done is resisting against friction over the longer path which is certainly more than the straight shortest path .  ,1

What rights do I have in dealing with a lemon car ?  I bought a 2005 Ford Taurus used with 28000 miles at a Toyota Dealership with the remainder of the warranty 3 years or 36000 miles on it .   I got it in December and it started having problems in April and I keep taking it to the Ford Dealership but they have been unable to fix it and told my husband yesterday that even though they can feel the problem they dont know what is wrong with it and Ford is telling them that its normal It has a major hesitation lurches and sometimes doesnt act like its getting gas at all What if any legal rights do I have or will I have to pay 5 years on a vehicle that no one can fix ?  Under the Commercial Statutes adopted by most states UCC every good sold by a merchant includes an implied not written law of merchantability unless validly disclaimed .  This means that the car you bought should be fit for its ordinary purpose driving on a day to day basis .  This is a basis for replacement of the car in and of itself .  On top of that you have an express 3 year warranty that they must honor .  If the dealer cannot fix the problem after three attempts generally this is the reasonable amount of attempts the dealership should have to fix the car before you force the manufacturer to honor the express warranty by replacing the car .  It may take a demand letter or even a lawsuit filed by an attorney before they know you mean business about enforcing the express warranty .  ,9

Any good anniversary gift ideas ?  My husband and I will be celebrating our 5th anniversary next week and I want to give him something special .   Any ideas ?  The traditional gift for the 5th anniversary is wood .  If you are traditional then you should keep that in mind .   While it may sound boring you will have to be creative . Since we are talking male gifts here then consider his hobbies and interests .   Does he love auto repair cars hunting fishing camping sports reading is he a couch potato ?  does he love the outdoors or indoor type things ? While you may think an oak frame with YOUR picture is a perfect gift believe me he will not think so .   It is the equivalent of you getting a blender or toaster from himFor traditions sake lets say ....... he hunts ..... a gun cabinet is nice . Fishing ........  a lure kit to make his own lures . Sports ..... locate a signed bat via local papers forget EbayCamping ..... plan a camping trip  For a non traditional gift .............. tryA coupon book .   One you make up yourself .   Do it on the computer .   Make coupons called Off the Hook  .   Husbands are always looking for ways not to take the trash out do the lawn or clean the garage or to simply lay around . You can add sexy coupons ..... one free no obligation massage . One night of total ME ... all about HIM dinner sports sex while he watches sports . One coupon you have to do anything I askAnd YOU cant complain if he turns in his couponBe creative  As far as purchaseing a gift for him .......... you can always do him a favor and buy him some tickets to his favorite team .   HE gets to chose his guest . The anniversary itself is about you both .   So plan that special dinner and night on the town or private dinner at home .   The gift to one another should say that I know you are an individual . Good luck and Happy Anniversary ,8

A question for the lovely Ladies of Yahoooooooooooo ?  Why is it that women quite often act like sex is really embarrassing humiliating to talk about ? Some women feel it should never be even spoke of .   Yet you love it just as much as the guys and some of you are really naughty too ...  I mean naughty in a good way .  Why put on the act ?   We all like it we all have it .. In fact we would not even be here if it was not for our parents having sex .  I may be a male but I think I can answer this .... Taboos are being usurped everyday .   However some are deeply seated in history religion and decorum such as discussion of sex by women .   The catholic religion frowns heavily on premarital sex you know the results of that .   Women in nearly every culture and location are still held to a certain level of expectations and one of those expectations is they should be seen and not heard and another in a certain culture we all know is that they should not even be seen ...   A boisterous woman is often looked at as shameful and loose . While this is trending in popular culture to be much less obvious there will most likely be residual influence for at least another generation .   This countrys puritanical history will always have a certain influence on popular culture the overall influence is being buried over the years . Many other countrys have a much looser view of this type of topic such as Germany Greece and Brazil they still are less accommodating on other concerns .  ,8
How to be stupid enough to believe in Dark Matter ?   the picture above something not seen in the inscribed circle has astronomers excited .  At an estimated 50 million lightyears from Earth they found a large mass of hydrogen a hundred million times the mass of the Suna galaxy of sorts but containing no stars .  The challenge they faced began with the fact that the cloud is rotating way too fast in apparent defiance of gravity .  Without some other force acting on the cloud it should fly apart .  The astronomers assumed this force must be gravity .  As reported in the BBC story on the discovery there must be a stronger gravitational force acting than can be accounted for using visible matter .  But this is the same problem posed by galaxies they rotate too fast for gravity to hold them together .  Due to the similarities in rotational dynamics the investigators of VIRGOHI21 concluded that the remote cloud is a starless galaxy The way science progresses is by postulating possible options it doesnt mean that any one of them is the answer only that it is a possible answer .  From all the possible answers peer review will pick the most likely explanation and accept it temporarily in a conditional mode until it can be demonstrated that in fact this is the correct answer .  Otherwise it gets thrown out .  Everything is accepted as a possible answer not as the answer .  ,1

How come some Christians dont like people persecuting theyre religion ?  And then they start persecuting other peoples religions ?  This not aimed at all Christians because I know a lot of them dont do this .  Nobody likes to be persecuted do they ?   Of course Christians dont like people persecuting their religion .   Thats not too hard to understand I think . Christians believe that they are sent with a message that will save people from death and from hell .   Many of them feel as if there isnt much time left and that unsaved people are in serious danger .   If you thought a child were in the way of a speeding train wouldnt you try to save it ?   Maybe you would shove people out of the way to do it ?   Would you really care if their feelings got hurt as long as you could rescue the child ?  Yes many Christians come off as being arrogant and overbearing and that is sad .   Their marching orders as given by their LEADER Jesus Christ dont include arrogance indeed Jesus commanded them to be humble .   Go figure . I am a Christian .

what are the chances of getting into med school with a mcat of 15 ?  My husband just got his mcat score of 15 and is devastated .  His gpa is about a 3 . 5 .  He has already applied to about 30 schools all over the U . S .  and Mexico .  What are the chances of him being accepted ??  Unless he is african american hispanic or native american  not too good at least for US schools .  If he is willing to go to the Caribbean or Mexico then he will be fine .  Those schools arent too concerned about MCAT scores as long as you can afford the tuition .  Be sure he applies to Ross University  probably the best of the Caribbean schools . If he wants to stay in the US  better take the August test .  I would suggest taking a Princeton Review course .  ,3
Are we living inside an atom ?  if solar system and atoms have similar structure  then could it possible that we are living inside some atom .  As it has been proved that atom does not have any discreet boundaries bt the probability density of finding an electron decreases as we go away from nucleous .  and similarly solar system has no discreet boundaries .  And also the volume occupied by nucleous is very small as compared to the whole atom .... and same is the case of sun with respect to solar system .... there are many similarities like this ... So could it possible that we are living inside an atom ..? please dont try to prove me wrong ...... just think about it ..  Very good question ..... The universe mocks itself .  The sun does act somewhat like a nucleus the planets like electrons ..... you can transfer this idea to the galaxies also .  If we live in an atom ....... I actually am quite confident that we do . Its the only kind of theory that makes any sense . Its explains the big bang theory an eternal atomic level matter antimatter reaction that plays it little game until a new bang starts a new universe and so onIt also would help to understand the idea of infinite dimensions much better .   If we live in an atom then we are part of a system that is part of a bigger system that is part of a universe that is an atom ..... etc . You are really on to something here .  Remember that all and I mean every truly great scientist that ever was got the laugh .  Keep thinking about it . And as for the physicsengineer geeks .......... with your android minds ........ For the 30 years you have done nothing to advance the science ....... Instead of trying to build a better bolt try and invent something that disposes of the need of a bolt in the first place .....

what is the maximum posibble 3 digit prime number ?  give hints ?  997 is correct .   Start at 999 and go backwards .   999 is divisible by 3998 is divisible by 2997 is prime because its not divisible by 235711131719232931 or 37 .   We only have to check up to 37 because 37  37  1369 which is bigger than a 3 digit number .   If a prime number bigger than 37 would divide into 997 then the quotient would be less than 37 and that quotient would divide 997 but we checked and no numbers less than 37 divide 997 do 997 is prime . That is known as the sieve of eratosthenes .  ,1

in baseball how many runs do you score in a home run and is there any thing bigger than a home run to score ?  Well if you hit a home run it depends on how many people are already on base .   The highest you can get is a grand slam which is four runs .   Thats because theres a person on first second and third and then theres the batter which makes the fourth .   You can score by being batted in .   If theres a player on third and a batter hits a single making it to first base then most likely the runner on third will make it home to score one . EditSo it doesnt necessarily have to be a home run .   It can be a single double triple how many bases the batter can run without getting out or even a sacfly which is a sacrifice fly outball goes in air and is caught by a fielder but still scores someone .   Runners can run even if the ball is out if there is one or less outs ... 2 outs means that the batter can be third out and end the inning so nobody can run . Hope this helps ,5

What is the traditional way to monogram someone who has a first name 2 middle names and last name ?  The traditional way for 3 names is first name initial is smaller last name initial is large middle name initial is smaller .   What is the proper monogram etiquette for a person who has 2 middle names ?   Do you leave out the 2nd middle name initial ?  This is a question that will come up more and more often when the new generation of younguns come of age .   I have a grandaughter with 2 middle names and a nephew with 3 middle names .   I could get on a soap box about the indicisive nature of young people these days but I will hold my tongue .   I think the traditional monogram is here to stay for now and it only allows for 3 letters .   Some folks will say choose the first middle name but it is my opinion that the person should be  able to choose hisher on monogram .   First name last name middle name of choice .   Of course there are a number of people who do not go by their first name at all .   That opens up a whole nuther can of worms  It is just a monogram .   Do what makes you happy .   No worries ,0

How do I start investing my money ?  Im 25 and I would like to start saving for retirement .   Does anyone know of a good firm that can guide me through this process ?  First pay off all short term debt .  If you have a credit card interest rate of say 21 thats an instant taxfree return of 21 per year on your money . Next if your company has a 401k with matching funds fund your 401k to the maximum match amount .  Free money is good . If your company doesnt have matching funds then fund your Roth IRA to its maximum 4000 .  Taxfree growth is good .  Id go with a noload low cost mutual fund company like Fidelity Vanguard or T Rowe Price .  If you have money left over after youve funded the 401k to the maximum match do this step with the extra money . If you still have more money for longterm investing go back to the 401k and invest in that up to what you can afford . And get yourself an elementary education in personal finance .  Youre going to get a lot advice here and you wont know who to believe .  Well you can believe this no one is going to care as much about your money as you are .  No one is going to watch it as closely as you are especially someone whos got multiple accounts to look after .  So get yourself a foundation so youll know if someone is actually giving you good advice or not .  Personally I recommend The Only Investment Guide Youll Ever Need by Andrew Tobias .  Itll give you an overview of everything you need to know stocks bonds real estate insurance etc ..  Then you can decide if you need a deeper education in anything .  Good luck ,6

Men how does sex effect your glucose reading ?  Mine goes up 10 to 20 points .   Is that reasonable ?  I guess it could be possible that sex could increase your glucose ....  especially after ejaculation .   When you ejaculate there is a rush of epinephrine and norepinephrine adrenaline .   This causes your heart to race blood pressure to increase and also your liver to release glucose from glycogen .   I am assuming that you are a diabetic ...  for most people sex does not alter blood sugar at all because the body is very good at keeping blood sugar constant ...  that is unless you are a diabetic .  ,2

what is the best entry level nursing course to take  ?  a course that would lend me a job without much competiton and age restriction be it at hospitals or private clinics .  You have to complete a nursing program in order to be a nurse .   Your choice would be to be a registered nurse vs .  a practical nurse .   The difference is that registered nurses are higher up on the food chain so to speak .   They are allowed to do more than LPNs and are actually the immediate supervisors of LPNs .   For either career choice you have to complete a program of study .   For me I opted to get a Bachelors Degree in Nursing which is a 4 year college degree .   This is one pathway to become and RN .   You could also go through an associate degree course which is 2 years .   There are still some diploma nursing programs around which usually run through hospitals and are anywhere from 18 to 24 months in length .   For all 3 tracks you can take the boards to become a registered nurse .   LPNs usually go to school for less time however they also must complete a national board licensure before they can actually be a nurse .   Most of the programs where I live are around 12 to 18 months to become an LPN . The best program depends on what you want to do .   The hisgest entry level nurse is the Bachelors prepared nurse .   This option gives you the biggest knowledge base and your opportunities to advance typically are easier .   There are many diploma or associate degree RNs who progress very nicely though .   A big advantage of a Bachelors degree is that you can go on to graduate school to become a nurse practitioner or nurse anesthetist without having to go through the undergraduate classes .   If you arent interested in furthering your career then either of the other options are good .   Send me a private message if you have any other questioins .   I just went through all of this ,3
what would happened if a christian is dating a unbeliever  knowing she shouldnt ?  and lets say that christian is your daughter .  what to do ?  if she has feelings for the  guide and lets say he is a good student . who stays out of trouble . and then she says well god can change him if i pray about it .  do you think god can hear her prayers ?  Mixing of the faiths ?  Fire and brimstone rolls eyesOf course she should be allowed to date the nonChristian boy .  Love transcends doctrine and it does not come in limited supply ones love for God should not prevent one from loving another human being . The boy sounds like he is of good virtue anyway Christian virtue if you prefer even if he is not of Christian faith so I personally do not see any reason to forbid the two from dating each other .  ,0

If you have a small compus as used by the early age sailors you will see the north is indicated at northen pole even if you make it rorate it will come back to its position again and show the north direction .  Once you reach the exact north pole then the compus will not work it will keep rotating as the magnetic lines will pass through and thus you will know that you are at exact north pole ....  and same is true for south pole as well  ...  hope I have answered your question ...   ,1

Help Any tips ?  I have a college interview on Friday and its my first interview ever Im so nervous I dont know what to expect .  Can you give me any tips any dos and donts ?  What will they as me ?  Is there any unmentioned dress code ?  When I go in do I have to shake their hand ?  As you can see I have no idea please help me I dont know what the questions will be as I dont know what the course is and probably wouldnt have a clue even if I did however interveiw tips I can do Do go in and shake their hands it is polite and confident .  Use good eye contact not overly much as that can seem agressive but make sure you look at them when answering questions  no eye contact at all looks deceitful or shifty .  Give yourself time to answer questions they are not going to mind if you take a couple of secs  to answer as it shows you are thinking about what you say not great long pauses a minute long though .  Make sure your voice is audible and clear  dont mumble or rush too much .  Dress smartly  as it is college I dont think you need to go the whole business suit type route but not jeans or sportswear  just something smart casual .  Do prepare beforehand  you wouldnt be applying if you didnt know a little something about the subject you want to study  so just make sure you read around it and have a think about your other interests outside the academic as well as that will show you to be a well rounded person .  And lastly  DONT PANIC  Stay calm and be yourselfI wish you all the luck in the world Im sure youll do great .  ,3

Is there a company with a cheap entrance fee that also has a vast list of tradable stocks ?  I would love to find a site that trades high performance stocks but ALSO trades penny stocks .  Serious answers only pleaseThanks I saw someone answer with a bunch of websites .  Some websites are good mind you .  But since you are dealing with the Internet you are going to get some serious information overload . Some offer more stock than others . Are you sure you know what you are doing ?  A stock is a stock and it only goes for one price .  No one can give discounts . I say who cares about the cheap entrance fee .  I see someone above referred to some cheap stuff go with that  but cheap entry fees to buy stocks should be the least of your worries .  I would love to find a site that trades high performance stocks but ALSO trades penny stocks .  If you are looking for a guru or a hot tip .  Forget it .  If things like that work those people wont be giving away their knowledge freely .  And if it were that easy we would all be doing it .  Keep reading and educating yourself and good luck ,6

why the transition metals have high melting point have high density and forming coloured ?  why theyre called as a collection of metal ?  Transition metals have high melting points because they are metals All metals have high melting points But some transition metals have exceptionally high melting points like Vanadium and Nickiel because they form a partially half filled 3d subshell for Vanadium and a fully filled 3d orbital for Nickiel which adds to an extra stability to the element .  Hence it is more difficult to remove the electron and thus result in the high melting point .  Since transition metals are all in the 4th period its Ar would be large too .  Since Ar is large naturally density would be high .  Because massno .  of molecules x Ar And density is defined as mass  volume .  The specialty of transition mentals is that the energy levels of the orbitals are close enough to overlap each other .  When electrons of a transition metal gains energy and is excited it is promoted to the 4s orbital .  However it is unstable at that level and soon drops back to the 3dorbital .  In order to return to the 3dorbital it must remove some of its energy and the energy is light .  That is why there are different colours in transition metals .  Because it only releases a specific amount of energy which relects different colours of light .  This process is also known as dd transition .  ,1

Is there a test that I can take that can help me to decide which career is the best for me ?  I am about to start college and even though I like Nursing  and Criminal Justice I would like to know if there is anything out there that I might be good at that I an not thinking of right now I was wondering is theres a test out there that can help me to make that decision ?  Many high schools offer the ASVAB which is actually a military test that helps tell you what vocations you would have an aptitude for .   They dont require you to want to join the military after all your tax dollars are paying for this test and there seems to be ways to get at the test online though I havent tried it . One of the most helpful books on the subject is What Color is your Parachute and it has tons of information that will help you ... theres even a workbook to go with it though this one is so popular your public library should have a copy of the latest and greatest version . One our college liked to give people was the MyersBriggs Type Indicator which is not particularly helpful but it can tell you what types of things you might be best suited for .   Id give you an online link but this would be one that Id just pick up one of the books  from the public library and work though the questionaire in paper form . Any of these would be a great start  but once you actually enroll you can and will likely spend your first semester in general studies courses .   Use that time to talk to the college career office .   They will have more books and tests than you can imagine . Good luck ,3

If someone asks why do you accept this text as the word of God is it a religious question .?  Or is the religious question  Why should I accept this text as the word of God . Is there a difference between why do YOU and why SHOULD I ?  If someone asks why do you accept this text as the word of God is it a religious question .?    I think it is a question of faith or belief not religion since it is something Iyou accept as true . Or is the religious question Why should I accept this text as the word of God .    Perhaps the religious question is actually       Is this text the word of God ?  and the response to that question is either belief doubt or a combination of both .   Remember the man who said to Jesus I believe .   Help my unbelief .? Is there a difference between why do YOU and why SHOULD I ?     Isnt it a difference of position ?   If you already know something is true by means of your own training tests and thinking but I dont know it yet whether I SHOULD know it already depends upon my experience and age and training and education etc .  ,0

What does an arrogant elitist left wing agenda mean .?  This phrase was used in an article about the New York Times publishing news about terrorist financing .

He published information during a time of war that will aid enemies of this country . He is an elitist as he believes that the press is above the law and can do whatever they want regardless of the implications on us .

I want too buy a specialized rockhopper mountain bike with a 17 inch frame .   My height is 58 .  Will it work ?  The easiest and most effective way to judge the fit of a mountain bike it by checking standover clearance which is the amount of space between your crotch and the top tube of the bike when you stand over it . Generally speaking standover clearance should be between 1 and 3 on a mountain bike . HOW TO TEST1 Stand over the top tube of the bike with your legs shoulder width apart2 Now lift the bike front and back until your crotch is resting on the top tube .   You can do this by grabbing hold of the top tube with one hand in front of your body and the other in back . 3 Finally check standover clearance by looking at the space between your tires and the ground you are still lifting the bike right ?.   Again this should be between 1 to 3 for a mountain bike .   This assumes you have the bike inhand and physically with you to perform this test .   In case you are purchasing something online for example have a look at what the folks at Active . com say ...  ,5

why do you support the racist george bush ?  he uses photo opps and political gatherings to position blacks at the entrance and when the speach begins and the cameras pan the room all the colorfull people are absent somehow . do not think for one minute george is a man who beleives in equality of the races he is a skilled manipulator and is politicaly empowered to  reflect a certain look that sends america a messege . you can not tell me a few people of color are really helping represent there fellow americans and people they are portreyed to represent . THEY serve the government and george is a racist . plain as the nose on your face watch him closely and you will see his posture around minoritys it is not one of acceptance more one of repulsion  .  Of course he is a racist .  Dont you know that he ordered the city of  New Orleans to be flooded in order to get all the black people out of the city ?  He knew that many of these people would have no place to go and that they would have no choice but to join the military which is why he personally sent hundreds of Army recruiters to the Astrodome and other shelters around the US .   He figured he could kill two birds with one stone get rid of the poor black people and keep his blood thirsty drive for world domination alive at the same  time  By the way is anybody interested in buying some prime ocean front real estate in Arizona or New Mexico ??  ,9

Plus Sized Strip Club ?  My friend and I were talking the other day and he said that he would like to open up a strip club down by the college in our town .  As we continued talking he said that he would like the strip club to be for plus sized woman .  He said that most men dont really like the girls that are real skinny and most like women of plus size .  He also said that a lot of bigger women arent confident in the way that they look and that it could actually help with their self esteem .  I dont know if this is a good idea or not .  What do you think ?  Please explane why or why not and please serious answers only .  There are clubs for dominants  submissives gay clubs and clubs for swingers to hook up .   So why not a strip club for men or women who enjoy a fuller form ?   I have said for years now usually as a punchline  yet halfseriously too that if I ever had the financial means I would open such a club in Las Vegas and call it Phatt Chicks .  That was long before the Phatt Pharm clothing line was launched .   I had the name first  Dang I should have copyrighted it or trademarked it or whatever you do  I could be rich  Oh well ..... Lets face it we live in a sexually diverse culture .   Just because many men would reject such a club I dont doubt that there is a market for your product .   The reason I would select Vegas for Phatt Chicks is that you would have a large crosssection of the adult population in a city that was created tfor the express purpose of providing an outlet for adults to let it all hang out .   Besides that  its Vegas Baby . Good luck on your proposed venture .   Feel free to send me my cut if you use the name I have proposed .   Thanks ,6
What do I need to do to help my realtionship marriage ?  I have been with my husband for over 4 yrs and it is going down hill .  I hate because there are times I think of my exs .  It really sucks .  I think I am somewhat still in love but like a little .  And I know I do not want to split for my kids and because I do not think we have worked to much on it .  Well I am pretty unhappy in all the aspects of the realtionship he is becoming too macho and is always telling me things like you are gaining weight and who in the hell would want someone like you .  You know I like romantic guys and he has killed all the desire to be with him .  I know I have to because I do not hold my tongue too much I say what I have to say .  I know I am wrong but he makes me sick it is like i cant even stand his presence .  And I have tried to work on it .  But the more I work on it he starts with stupid comments and attitudes .  He tells me I am the best thing you ever had in your life .  And I feel like just screaming and letting him have it but he always starts crying .  hmm this question is actually helping me more than my answer would help you .  But I think that taking a break and separating for a bit without getting divorced is a good idea .  Then I just like you would try really hard to keep working on it and after getting some more strength  come back and battle some more .  But if that still doesnt get through to him  leave him see if he understands the seriousness of the situation that way ,8

Why do conservatives label everyone that disagrees with them as antiAmerican ?  And why do conservatives believe that more than a few liberals actually like Michael Moore ?  They have no legitimate argument if we are talking about the Bush failures they blame it on Clinton If we are talking about the criminal acts of Bush they mention Clinton and when they run out of thing to blame on Clinton they then go to name calling and since unamerican is suppose to mean that we do not believe the conservatives are right then they use that .  They probably think that Clinton was unamerican because he ran the country the way it should be run ,9
Im curious will someone tell ?  How a gal feels in double penetration into the pink or one in the pink and one in the stink ?  Im straight but sometimes for a change or to have a feeling of good resistence in penetration I do go for the stink .  But its seldem that my gal would react as being in heaven during this latter act .  And from the graphic videos of the double penetration I get the impression that the gal is being tortured if also not being outright humilated .  No guesses please .  Only serious persons with such experience expected to respond .  When you start fooling around in a womans anal area you must work your way in slowly at first ..   You dont just try to push up in her it hurts too much .   You must first loosen it up using dildo or whatnot make sure you have lots of lube and make sure that she is incredibly turned on beforehand and while youre loosening it up it helps to continue to stimulate her nether region .   And wait until she is REALLY excited before sticking things back there .   Done right it can be a mutually satisfying experience .   And then filling up the other hole at the same time ... unbelievableAs for double penetration OUCH .   Good luck with that .  ,0

Relationships with partners who are not out and open ?  I dont have anything particular in mind just that my ex aggrivated me immensely because she would act like we were going out holding hands quick kisses etc .  but if anyone asked her she would deny that she was attracted to girls and tell them that I was just barking up the wrong tree .   She wouldnt even tell people be both knew were Kinsey2s or higher that she liked girls and I dont understand that at all .   Of course if youre not sure how someone will take it excercise caution but if you know theyre gay why not gain an ally as it were ?   Also a current very good friend of mine who I am almost sure is a K6 maybe a 5 lists her preference as straight on myspace and wont let me post anything that makes her sound gay .   Dont these girls realize that there is as much support as hatred out there if you know where to look ?   Why are they ashamed of who they are ?   Lastly  is dating someone like this a good idea ?  OMG my x did the same exact thing to me .   My x broke up with me but she will still hug and kiss me .   Like she keeps reeling me back in .   Confusing i know .   When we were first going out she made it quite clear that she could never come out to her parents .   Then a few days ago she says that she is really only 20 gay .   What a slam in the face to me .   She wont accept anything of who she is .   Maybe she believes that denying the truth will make her life easier .  I really dont know if dating someone like this is a great idea but it depends on how much you care for them .   I still love my x a lot and if she wanted to get back together i would be all for it but at the same time i dont get the full benefits of a healthy relationship .   The only quetion you need to ask is if the good out weighs the bad .   Do you still enjoy being around her ?   If her denial is upsetting you that much then maybe it is better to break it off but if you still seriously care for her then it makes it a little more difficult to just let go .  ,0

What do the words at Isaiah 4310 mean to you ?  The Scriptural account that Jehovahs Witnesses draw on for their name is in the 43rd chapter of Isaiah .  There the world scene is viewed as a courtroom drama The gods of the nations are invited to bring forth their witnesses to prove their claimed cases of righteousness or to hear the witnesses for Jehovahs side and acknowledge the truth .  Jehovah there declares to his people Ye are my witnesses saith Jehovah and my servant whom I have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there was no God formed neither shall there be after me .  I even I am Jehovah and besides me there is no saviour . Isaiah 4310 11 American Standard Version . Jehovah God had witnesses on earth during the thousands of years before Jesus was born .  After Hebrews chapter 11 lists some of those men of faith Hebrews 121 says So then because we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us let us also put off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us .  Jesus said before Pontius Pilate For this I have been born and for this I have come into the world that I should bear witness to the truth .  He is called the faithful and true witness .  John 1837 Revelation 314 Jesus told his disciples You will receive power when the holy spirit arrives upon you and you will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth . Acts 18 .  ,0

During sunrise and during moonrise on full moon nights why does the sun and moon respectively appear large ?  The sun is more or less at the same distance from the earth on the same day so why does the sun appear so large during dawn and why does the moon appear large during moonrise ???  It is an illusion .  People tend to perceive objects on the horizon as larger than they really are but you can destroy the illusion by looking at the horizon upside down .  Really I have tried it .  And it is not only the Moon but trees and buildings too .  As you tilt your head more and more things on the horizon start to look smaller .  I notice that sideways is enough tilt for me to see things on the horizon as noticeable smaller than when looking upright .  The usual suggestion is to bend over and look at the horizon between your legs but that is just to embarrassing for me so I tilt my head sideways until I am looking upside down to one side of my legs and notice the size changing when I am about half Way to being upside down .  Try it it is easy ,1

How can I tell if I have a complete miscarriage ?  My baby wasnt growing after 6 weeks and no heartbeat either .  I didnt want a DC so my Doctor inserted 4 tablets inside me to induce miscarriageabortion .  Went back to the doctor for followup 2 days later and did an ultrasound .  I was told that all tissues had pass uterus was clean and uterine lining was thin .  I still see some tissue passing when I got home along with blood clots .  The blood thats flowing out is very thick and stretchy also flowing out really slow .  Is that normal ?  Anyway its been 10 days already and Im still bleeding .  Not a lot or heavy its just a little here and there throughout the day for about 3 days now .  How can I tell that all tissue had pass with that kind of bleeding ?  Miscarriage bleeding wasnt as heavy like what the doctor told me .  Its just like a normal period to me .  Although the bleeding looks like its going to stop any day now Im still worry that it might be an incomplete miscarriage .  Please help  Thanks If you continue to have bleeding then there may be some tissue that didnt get expelled from the uterus .   As long as the bleeding is scant you can probably just wait and see if the bleeding stops on its own .   If the bleeding continues the only thing to do at that point would be a DC .  ,2

My sense of the mainlargest difference between the two are in the required citation format APA citations are inline while Chicago citations are footnotes .   With modern word processing software footnotes are no longer the pain that they used to be so I dont think inline citations e . g .  I went to the store .  Bryson 2 is not significantly easier to use than footnotes . Why Chicago is better The reason I prefer using Chicago style and the footnote method is because the body of my my academic papers are less cluttered by citations after every sentence .  Also I think footnotes look more academic .. but thats just me .   And um I live and went to school in Chicago probably the best reason  . Why APA is better If you are a science major if you dont have a readily accessible and easily usable word processing program like Word if you prefer the simplicity of the APA citations if your professor likes it very important .  ,3

Using what we know of the atom how can you disprove the following view of the atom ?  This is a little crazy but here goes .   I met an individual who had his own theory of why electrons can not fall in the nucleus .   Here is what he said as we know electrons are attracted to the nucleus because of electromagnetic force .   We also know that they never reach the nucleus except in extreme occasion like a dying star .   He thinks that the reason why this is the case is because of strong force .   We dont know much about the characteristic of strong force only that it is able to overcome the effects of repulsion between two positive charged particles and that it ranges of effect is very small .   So he thinks that when the electron enters in to the inner most orbital that the strong force keeps it back from actually going into the nucleus .   I couldnt give a reason why that cant be possible so I looking for answer from someone that can explain why that is not possible .   ThanksBrad  We also know that they never reach the nucleus except in extreme occasion like a dying star .  Well thats a major flaw right there .  Electrons quite often anhihilate themselves via collision with the nucleus .  This is the cause of radioactive decay via electron capture .  There are literally millions of electrons falling into their atomic nuclei within 3 feet of where you are every second of every day .  ,1

what is javaTM ?  In computer scienceJava Sun a technology developed by Sun Microsystems for machineindependent software which encompasses Java programming language an objectoriented highlevel programming language Java Virtual Machine the virtual machine that runs Java byte code .  This is also referred to as the portion of Java that runs on your PC or the Java runtime environment JRE Java Platform the Java virtual machine plus API specifications Java Platform Standard Edition targets desktop environment Java Platform Enterprise Edition targets server environment Java Platform Micro Edition targets embedded consumer products JavaScript a scripting language syntactically similar to but semantically different from the Java programming languageLearn About Java Technology Java technology was created as a computer programming tool in a small secret effort called the Green Project at Sun Microsystems in 1991 .  The secret Green Team fully staffed at 13 people and led by James Gosling locked themselves away in an anonymous office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park cut off all regular communications with Sun and worked around the clock for 18 months .  They were trying to anticipate and plan for the next wave in computing .  Their initial conclusion was that at least one significant trend would be the convergence of digitally controlled consumer devices and computers .  A deviceindependent programming language codenamed Oak was the result .  To demonstrate how this new language could power the future of digital devices the Green Team developed an interactive handheld homeentertainment device controller targeted at the digital cable television industry .  But the idea was too far ahead of its time and the digital cable television industry wasnt ready for the leap forward that Java technology offered them .  As it turns out the Internet was ready for Java technology and just in time for its initial public introduction in 1995 the team was able to announce that the Netscape Navigator Internet browser would incorporate Java technology .  Now nearing its tenth year the Java platform has attracted over 4 million software developers worldwide use in every major industry segment and a presence in a wide range of devices computers and networks of any programming technology .  In fact its versatility efficiency platform portability and security have made it the ideal technology for network computing so that today Java powers more than 2 . 5 billion devices over 700 million PCs over 1 billion mobile phones and other handheld devices source Ovum 1 . 25 billion smart cards plus settop boxes printers web cams games car navigation systems lottery terminals medical devices parking payment stations etc .  Today you can find Java technology in networks and devices that range from the Internet and scientific supercomputers to laptops and cell phones from Wall Street market simulators to home game players and credit cards  just about everywhere .  The best way to preview these applications is to explore java . com the ultimate marketplace showcase and central information resource for businesses consumers and software developers who use Java technology .  Why Software Developers Choose Java Technology The Java programming language has been thoroughly refined extended tested and proven by an active community of over four million software developers .  Mature extremely robust and surprisingly versatile Java technology has become invaluable in allowing developers to Write software on one platform and run it on practically any other platform Create programs to run within a web browser and web services Develop serverside applications for online forums stores polls HTML forms processing and more Combine Java technologybased applications or services to create highly customized applica ,4
How do I get my DVD to read ?  Every time I put in my dvd it says there is nothing inserted in my computer .   How do I get it to read ???  Do you have your hardware specs ?  First you need a DVDROM or RW drive .  Also with that you should have recieved a dvd decoding program to watch video dvds like PowerDVD . If you have all of that its most likely that windows isnt recognising your drive as a DVD reader .  You can check this by entering your control panel opening the system information going to the Hardware tab and selecting device manager if the only device listed is marked as a CD reader or RW Windows doesnt have the right drivers for your DVD player .  ,4

A friend of mine has a child with asbergers .  My friend has trouble getting the child to keep up on hygiene .?  My friend cant get their child to shower and change their underclothes on a regular basis . Please send any info on how  to get this child to keep up on their hygiene .  Please no smart ass remarks .  This problem is quite taxing on my friend .  Please any parent with a child with asbergers reply with any help .  I am not familiar with asbergers but I work with adults with mental disabilities that have hygiene issues .   One thing I have them do is set out clean night clothes in the morning as well as whatever clean clothes they plan on wearing the next day .   When they get ready for bed it become part of the nightly routine to put on the clothes we laid out earlier .   This does not always work of course but I have noticed improvement .   I also will not allow them in my car to go to appointments ect if they have a strong body odor .   I will arrive early and make them shower if I need to .   After a while most of them found it was easier to just shower before I got there .   It takes about 2 weeks for something to become a habit or routine .  I wish your friend all the luck in the world .  Side note  If this child is old enough to take part in social activities I would recommend People First The Ark or Special Olympics .   Being around other people with disabilities and doing something he enjoys would be more incentive to keep clean .  ,2

Are we friends or Lovers ?   Is he using me ?  I am dating a guy who told me that he needs some time to figure things out .   He tells me that he has a lot on his plate right now and cant handle a full blown relationship .   Yet he calls me a lot and we end up talking for hours and hours about anything and everything .   He has apologised several times for hurting me .   Is he using me ?   Should I cut him loose or wait and see where it goes .   I like that we can talk so easily .   Maybe his feelings for me scared him so he felt he needed to back off some .   Any thoughts on what is going on here ?  People who say they dont want a relationship  then end up calling you being with you having sex etc are usually people who like to have their cake and eat it too .   He wants the freedom of not being in a relationship but enjoys the benefits of being with someone at the same time .   You should tell him that you wanna give him time to figure out what he wants  and whether he wants you as a girlfriend .   There is nothing wrong with being his friend  but dont treat him any different than you would your other friends i . e .  no 2am booty calls .   Saying he has too much going on right now doesnt make sense  if you really like someone you want them in your life and usually having a significant other helps things because you have someone there for you .  ,8

has anyone heard of using bromcriptine to increase memory ?  Bromocriptine is a semisynthetic derivative of the ergo group of ergot alkaloids is a dopamine receptor agonist and a prolactin inhibitor .   It is a potent D2 agonist but also displays partial action on D1 receptors and a prolactin inhibitor .    Its first major antiaging use is the enhancement of dopamine a key brain neurotransmitter that undergoes an agerelated decline .  Accordingly some neurologists have stated that if we all live long enough we shall all become senile .   This is due to the fact that abnormally low levels of dopamine 70 to 80 loss are then diagnosed as Parkinsons disease hence protection and enhancement of the dopamine producing neurons is a key strategy for antiaging medicine .   Not surprisingly bromocriptine is used in conjunction with drugs such as deprenyl and Ldopa in the management of Parkinsons disease and senile disorder .   But bromocriptine can be used for antiaging purposes and memory enhancer also .  ,1

Why are Group 7A elements called Halogens ?  Please do not copy and paste Wikipedias Definition ofThe term halogen was coined to mean elements which produce salt in union with a metal .  It comes from 18th century scientific French nomenclature based on erring adaptations of Greek roots .... because that explaination didnt sufficiently explain how the world halogen came about .     Thanks much in advance Well  as Wikipedia mentions The term halogen was coined to mean elements which produce salt in union with a metalIn Greek alas is saltand genno means to give birth toAs roots with latin characters they are spelled a bit differerently so you have the halo part for salt and gen for giving birth to .  So halogens were named after their property to react with metals producing salt like oxygen was named after its property to produce acid  oxosacid and hydrogen  hydorwater to produce water . The first halogen to be discovered was chlorine by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1774 .  However Scheele believed it was a compound containing oxygen and in 1810 Sir Humphry Davy proved that chlorine was actually an element .  I dont know though when and who exactly came up with the term halogen .  ,1

Why do people call acting like a real person instead of a minstrel character acting white ?  Blue blazes Im so sick of being labeled an oreo simply because I act like a real person instead of a onedimensional stereotype .  Heaven forbid a black person think for themself instead having liberals tell them what to think or like something else other than hiphop or menthol cigarettes So much for the civil rights movement .  I wish hiphop and those crappy UPN shows would just die because its just a modern day minstrel show that makes Amos N Andy look progressive and brainwashes black kids into thinking this is how they should think and behave portraying a distorted idea and definition  of blackness .  Ironically enough the stuff that actually is racist and smutty is the material that doesnt slide by the censors .  I just had this conversation with somebody on another board .   Let me cross post it .   BTW I believe you are correct . I care about people not color and I hear what you are saying .   So anyway this is a reply to a person that was playing that race card ... The angry black thing doesnt work for me Belinda .  My mothers boss Head of personel for NIH was a black woman .  She died a couple of years ago of breast cancer .  My parents who are in their late 70s still keep track and visit her husband .  My boss is black .  I think the world of the guy .  The manager of the help desk where I work and I work for a multbillion dollar a year company is a black woman .  She has 25 employees .  So you want to talk entertainment ?  And no Superfly crap .  The father on Fresh prince of Belaire a judge .  Aldus Huxley .  James Earl Jones .  Oprah remember her ?  Black Americans are moving into positions of power .  Mayors Congress Supreme Court Generals Admirals .  And no I am not discounting the drug problem crime rate and prison population .  I hear you on those .  But Belinda you dont want me whitebread boy to solve those for you .  That makes me either the liberal or conservative solution you were talking about .  The best I can personally do is come up and greet you look you in the eye and shake your hand or hug you and not really care about the color of your skin .  All I can do is accept you as an equal and I do .  The rest well up to you folks to figure out the answers it would seem .  You sure do not want whitebread doing it .  We have screwed up enough already .  ,0

Black .  White .  What does it matter ?  Im dating this really awesome guy .  Im black and he just happens to be white .  All my life Ive never cared about what makes one race different from another .  We are all still people .  So please tell me why to people still give us that look ?  And why does my mom dislike my boyfriend so much because of his skin color ?  Will I eventually ignore everyone else ?  Has anyone gone through this before ?  Racism is alive and well in USA and in many other countries .   And if you are going to have an interracial relationship then you have to be prepared to deal with racism .   And if you get married and have racially mixed kids then they too will have some difficulty dealing with racism .    Its hard for such a kid to choose sides when his black friend says something against the white folks or his white friend says the same against the black people . But I think that interracial friendship and marriage is worth fighting for .   You only need to take a look at such people as Tiger Woods and Hale Berry  to see what good such relationships can bring .   If your man is better than anyone else you know then dont listen to your mother and settle for second best .   You have only one life to live and you must make the best of it regardless of what other people say .  ,8

Are homosexuals treated differently in society ?  If they are treated differently how so on what level and in what way ?  Have you ever experienced this first hand ?  and have you yourself ever treated a homosexual differently ?  It all depends on where you live .  I am gay and live in Provo Utah but for the most part I have been treated very well .  I often notice that most of the time people who find out that I am gay tend to be a lot more careful what they say around me so as not to offend me .  A lot of people are also very nice once they find out because they also dont want to offend me or hurt my feelings .  The only negative situations I have ever encountered were not directed at me personally but people sometimes have said that they dont agree with homosexuality as a lifestyle but theyre always usually pretty quick to add that it doesnt affect how they view me as an individual which is okay with me .  I dont expect everyone to accept my sexuality .  My personal motto is that if I expect people to be openminded toward me then I should pay them the same respect whether I agree with them or not .

on Nikes usually they have a hole on the tounge for the laces would u use the hole ?  It depends if lace your shoes up tight or loose when you play .   If you pull all your laces tight the tongue will usually stay in place .   However if you dont like your shoes tight then you should consider using the laces hole in the tongue .   The laces hole is used to help prevent the tongue of the shoe from falling off to one side while you play .   Some recreational players will complain that they dont like a shoe because the tongue keeps going off to the side .   Someone should point out that the laces hole can help with this problem .  ,5

What are some ways that a recent college graduate can use to invest ?  I have just started working and instead of wasting my money buying an Ipod and other gadgets I am looking for a way to make my money work for me .   Any ideas ?  First pay off all short term debt .   If you have a credit card interest rate of say 21 thats an instant taxfree return of 21 per year on your money . Next if your company has a 401k with matching funds fund your 401k to the maximum match amount .   Free money is good . If your company doesnt have matching funds then fund your Roth IRA to its maximum 4000 .   Taxfree growth is good .   Id go with a noload low cost mutual fund company like Fidelity Vanguard or T Rowe Price .   If you have money left over after youve funded the 401k to the maximum match do this step with the extra money . If you still have more money for longterm investing go back to the 401k and invest in that up to what you can afford . And get yourself an elementary education in personal finance .   Youre going to get a lot advice here and you wont know who to believe .   Well you can believe this no one is going to care as much about your money as you are .   No one is going to watch it as closely as you are especially someone whos got multiple accounts to look after .   So get yourself a foundation so youll know if someone is actually giving you good advice or not .   Personally I recommend The Only Investment Guide Youll Ever Need by Andrew Tobias .   Itll give you an overview of everything you need to know stocks bonds real estate insurance etc ..   Then you can decide if you need a deeper education in anything .   Good luck ,6

am looking to start my own business used car lot is there any banks that will floor plan on a used car lot ?  Let me start by appologizing to you if what follows is insulting .   I am trying to be completely honest and helpful . Are there any banks which will floorplan your startup used car lot ?   Yes but  ...   Many banks do not like to make floorplan loans because they are inherently risky collateral by its nature is mobile and tends to disappear .   Many banks do not like to lend to startup businesses because they do not have a history of success .   Many banks do not like to lend money to independent used car lots because they can be shady .   That said I suspect you might have a hard time finding a floorplan line of credit for a startup independent used car lot . I might suggest a loan company as opposed to a bank .   Be prepared to sign the loan personally and possibly mortgage your home as additional collateral .  ,6

i have not smoked marijuana in 1 year and a urine test showed a trace of thc why ?  i do take alot of herbal vitamins for kidneys immune system etcwould any of this affect the test Ok heres one optionTHC  Substances or Conditions which can cause false positivesDronabinol MarinolIbuprofen Advil Nuprin Motrin Excedrin IB etcKetoprofen Orudis KTKidney infection Kidney disease diabetes Liver DiseaseNaproxen AlevePromethazine Phenergan PrometheganRiboflavin B2 Hempseed OilHeres another optionSustiva is the HIV drug that has been most linked to false  urine tests for marijuana Sustiva also know as efavirenzStocrine is some parts of the world .  KHHeres anotherI worked in the field of mental health for 25 years anddrug testing was a common reality .  One of the facts whichshould be wellknown to anyone in the field is that THC gets stored in the fat cells so if one is at all overweightits likely that they have THC stored .  If the person thenexercises during the week of testing it can result in therelease of sufficient THC metabolites into the bloodstreamto yield a positive test since the test looks for metabolitesand not THC itself .  So you wont get stoned when the metabolitesare released into your bloodstream when you exercise but thetest will still detect them .  It can take several years for thesemetabolites to be released and excreted from the body so falsepositives in former cannabis users are not uncommon and this should be taken into consideration by test reporting agencies . Even normal activities of daily life and the concurrent levelof metabolism can and will release THC metabolites into thebloodstream and can produce a false positive . These are the best I could find .  I did a Yahoo Search for THC FalsePositive Urine Test .   You might want to continue searching Yahoo and Google for the Answer .  Ive sited my sources below .  Btw if I were you I would talk to a doctor and have a physical done just to be sure everythings ok as stated above it could be a sign of other serious conditionsSorry and Good Luck ,2

What would happen if Mercury and Venus were to collide ?  It is strange I had a dream last night that everyone was talking about the news about Mercury and Venus colliding and becoming one planet .  I dont recall anything occuring during the dayor even saying the words Mercury and Venus that would make me dream this .   But all the same what would happen if these two were to collide and is it possible ?  In the dream they collided because it was an inevitablitily where Mercurys rotation around the sun eventually brought about their collision . Weird .  I dont know what the dream means ..  maybe it has something to do with your signs .  Your sign represents one of the planets and you will collide and marry somebody who has the other sign ... Anyways ..  but in reality Neptunes moon is actually not only rotating around Neptune but its actually spiraralling towards it .  It is inevitable that one day the moon and neptune will collide .  ,1

what is nh3ntkn ?  IT IS SOME TYPE OF CHEMICAL USED IN WATER TREATMENT Definition for NH3NAmmonia Nitrogen  an inorganic dissolved form of nitrogen that can be found in water but in the presence of oxygen will convert to nitrate . Ammonia NH3N an inorganic form of nitrogen is contained in fertilizers septic system effluent and animal wastes .  It is also a product of bacterial decomposition of organic matter .  Ammonia NH3N NH3N becomes a concern if high levels of the unionized form are present .  In this form NH3N can be toxic to aquatic organisms .  The presence of unionized ammonia is a function of the NH3N concentration pH and temperature .  Conversion of NH3N to nitrite nitrogen by nitrification requires large quantities of oxygen which can kill aquatic organisms due to the lowered dissolved oxygen concentrations in water .  NH3N concentrations are reported in mgL NH3N .  ,1

In what orbit does the moon rotate around the sun ?  We all know from physics that the planets rotate around the sun on an elliptical orbit . But since the moon orbits the earthwhich in turn orbits the sunwould its orbit look like a helical spring while observing from the sun ?  The orbit of the moon is distorted by the earth and vice versa .   The orbits are also distorted slightly by the other planets .  However the distance between the earth and the moon is about 1400 of the distance from the earth to the sun .  Because of that the moons orbit is always curved towards the sun even though it isnt a perfect ellipse .  ,1

music question for those who believe in god and those who dont ?  i was listening to my ipod today and i wondered do those who beleive in god i had christians in mind to be honest care about what thier favorite musicians say in thier lyrics ?  if there is something religiously objectionable in some song will you not listen to that band ?  or will you not listen to that one song ? for example i like nine inch nails .  theres a some called heresy and the lyrics go your god is dead and no one cares if there is a hell ill see you there .  many would find this objectionable but would that prevent you from listening to this band if you liked other songs or the music in general ? im just curious .  As a believer I stay open to different views . I dont go around saying that I wont watch this program or listen to that song because it says something against my faith . I know the truth of what I believe and so I have no problem listening to or watching something that may go against my faith . Its not going to change my faith and anyone who thinks it will change their faith or hurt their faith doesnt in my view have a very strong faith to begin with ... I like Nine Inch Nails   ,0

what is the fastest way to remove a collection from equifax credit report ?  Im in the process of getting a mortgage and all of a sudden thiscollections pops up on my Equifax credit file .   I know it will hurt my score already .   I need to know the best way to go about getting it removed .   I heard even if you pay it off it will remain as a negative .  Any good advice ?  Let me warn you of something . If you were to pay off this bill and IF the creditor notifies the credit bureau your account is changed to paid .   However it will still show that you had late payments or that the account was in collections .   This is still a negative item on your report and it will still hurt your score . Does it make sense to pay off your bill and still have bad credit ? The problem is that the only way you can get a negative item removed is for the creditor to tell them to remove it .   There is no other way except to go through the dispute process and hope the creditor does not respond to the investigation .  What I advise people to do is negotiate with the creditor .   Tell them that in exchange for paying off the bill they must agree IN WRITING to remove all negative information from your credit report .   See the link below for more info .  ,6

My sister is mexicanamerican too but she has natural blond hair and hazelgreen eyes ?  My sister is beautiful with her natural blond hair and coloredeyesbut she looks REALLY different from me .

Mexico was invaded by Spaniards many of whom had familial ties to the north England France etc .   These Spaniards raped many native Mexican women some actually had the respect to marry natives and some American cowboys since then have added to the gene pool .

Whre may I find the credit reports that certain companies pull ?  honda financial .  I figure there is a site .?  To answer your question there is no website that provides which credit bureau a creditor pulls from .  One way to find out is to get denied and then they must tell you which ones they pulled from .   The best bet is to get your credit in order across the board .  Not all 3 bureaus carry the same information but you never know when information may cross over .  Would hate to do all the work in the world to get Equifax up and then find out that Experian shared some info or something .  Or worse that the creditor pulled from all 3 anyway . Work on getting your scores up by having the right balance of revolving credit installment credit and payments made on time .  Negative items within the last 24 months may be affecting your scores so you may want to address them .  If older than 24 months you may not need to worry about them until later but eventually you will want to get them straight too . No long term shortcuts in credit but with the right direction long terms excellent credit is attainable for anyone ,6
i cont continue my sex more than 1 or 2 Mins ... how can i full fill my wife ....?  Best Answer  Chosen by AskerTry what they call Kegel exercises .  They are easy to do and you can do them anywhere without anyone knowing . 1 Try to contract the muscles you would use to stop urinating .  You should feel your pelvic muscles squeezing your urethra and anus .  If your stomach or buttocks muscles tighten you are not exercising the right muscles . 2 Once youve found the right way to contract the pelvic muscles squeeze for 3 seconds and then relax for 3 seconds . 3 Repeat this exercise 10 to 15 times per session .  Try to do this at least 3 times a day .  Kegel exercises are only effective when done regularly .  Do these for awhile and you will see a big change in your performance and your own orgasms .

Do Democrats really understand what it takes to win a Presidential election ?  35 of the people who vote wont vote for a Democrat .  35 of the people who vote wont vote for a Republican .  Its the 30  like myself that actually determine whos running the country .  And WE vote for the one we like the best even if we dont like himher .  Because we dont like the other guy more .  Give us a Democrat who we like more than anyone else and well vote for himher .  I cant speak for anyone else .  But for me the sloganVote for me Im not a Republican doesnt trip my trigger .  How many agree with me ?  I want complete ideasNot sound bites like stop outsourcing jobs tax the wealthy mend the fences with  foreign countries and other blips .  You raise a very good point .  Part of the problem IMHO is that the Dems attempt to embrace a wider spectrum of the population than the Reps do these days .  Its hard to streamline so many interests . Part of the problem is that hard core elements dominate either party which make them less appealing to moderates .  This is reflected in the mistaken rhetoric that one is either a conservative or a liberal .  I have views that some consider liberal but support the death penalty and own several firearms for instance .  In the last election the Democrats ran a Liberal senator from a Liberal state against a moron with whom enough rednecks and Bible thumpers connected to eke out a win .  Bush could have been defeated .  All the Dems needed was a candidate who actually came out and stood for something .  I wanted to like Kerry but he lacked charisma and he seemed to say whatever he thought was politically advantageous .  Unfortunately the neofascists um neocons were able to seize on that indecisiveness as what the country doesnt need in a time of war of Bushies own making .  Result the guy who actually fought in a war was deemed a weaklingcowardliar while the cokesnorting deserter was The War President again in a war of his own making .  That the Democratic Party has allowed itself to be portrayed as Godless and soft on terrorism and national defense is a flatout disgrace .  They deserved to lose because they lacked the guts to run a candidate with strong convictions and a voting record to back them . Right now Obama looks like a candidate who could appeal to a broad spectrum of our increasingly diverse population .  But unless the DemoCommunist extremists drop their efforts to disarm the populace and thereby rendering us defenseless against enemies from within and without and to make us a socialist nation by lavishing benefits upon everyone itll be hard to vote for one .  ,9

Legalize it ?  Marajuana yes or no .  What would the impact be .  Laws are meant to establish social paradigms of conduct .  Sociology states that it is impossible for every individual to behave according to standarts in a society .  In simple words there will always be someone who will break the law or behave incorrectly .  Marijuana if used moderately and according to the correct standarts medicine for example is harmless but since it is impossible for every individual to follow the same path of correct behavior we conclude that there would always be misuses of marijuana ... and theres where laws enter ... to ensure that a majority behaves well .  Also ... laws are always broken ... if you abolish a law that is broken so often you would only increase that illegal conduct .  ,9

After that you can generally do thisControl Panel  Network Connections  Right click on your wireless connection  Wireless Networks tab  click to have Windows automatically configure your wireless settings . Then you should open a browser and connect to your router to configure your wireless settings in your router .   Most use Linksys so if you do just type  and go . Then if you hadnt set your password in it it defaults to adminadmin .   Feel free to change your settings to any secure password you feel like and apply this password to the wireless connection as soon as your wireless network card picks it up .   After that reboot the router and your notebook and you should be able to connect . If youre still experiencing problems then you might have conflicting devices .   Use device manager to rule this out .   Also connecting to another network not your own is not the best answer .   It doesnt provide you with the necessary security while on the internet .   If all else fails call tech support and allow them to help you .   ,4

Creationists why is evolution wrong .   I will read all answers .  So will other evolutionists .?  If you have something besides Genesis quotes weve read them some evidence of the microscopes that have looked at chimpanzee DNA that these microscopes were all busted  some evidence that all the fossils of australopithicus was faked we are awaiting your very intelligent responses .  Just thinking out loud here  Its funny how some people have the answers to their questions because these questions have been asked before a million times by the same asker .  It seems to me that the asker just doesnt want to hear what a certain group of people have to say .  Its fine but why ask if its been answered before is it because the answer wasnt unto their liking ?  I think people should ask themselves do they want an answer or are they spending their life trying to trip others that have a mustard seed of faith up ?  Does it really matter was Creationist think if you are not truly interested in what they think ?  Again just thinking out loud here and grabbing two points along the way ,0
Why Do Superficial Similarities Between Man And Ape Attract The Attention Of Evolutionists ?  There are many species in the world that resemble one another .  For instance there may be many living beings resembling a horse or a cat and many insects may look like one another .  These similarities do not surprise anyone .  The rhinoceros beetle and the rhinoceros also share certain superficial resemblances but it would be ludicrous to seek to establish some kind of an evolutionary link between these two creatures one being an insect and the other a mammal on the grounds of that resemblance .  The superficial similarities between men and apes do signify nothing .  Other than superficial similarity apes cannot be said to be closer to man than to other animals .  Actually if level of intelligence is considered then the honeybee producing the geometrically miraculous structure of the honeycomb or the spider building up the engineering miracle of the spider web can be said to be closer to man .  They are even superior in some aspects .  Because it fits in with their plan .  ,0

Is Adam in heaven or hell for commiting original sin ?  First Adam may not even be a real name but a representation .   The word really means dirt or dust adama . Taking him as a person all of us are like Adam .   Sometimes we are selfish .   Sometimes we help one another .   We strive to move toward doing things for one another that make the world better . The words heaven hell and original and sin are church words that try to explain things we really know nothing about in the first place .   What is important is to live our lives to the full .  ,0
Why do the conservatives want us to stay and pay in Iraq ?  Cant they see we will just keep losing troops .  Lives are valuable and nothing is about to change George Bush illegally and unconstitutionally invaded another sovereign nation for only two resons 1 He wanted to get even with Saddam Husseing for humiliating his daddy during Desert Storm and 2 Big Dick Cheney wants oil that oil that swimming underneath Iraqs sands .  Until he has a rocksolid ironclad arrangements in place NO TROOPS WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM IRAQ .  After all Cheneys buddies at Halliburton and ExxonMobil need to get richer and richer and richer . Bush Cheney and Rumsfeld are the most evil corrupt and incompetent morons ever to occupy the White House .  The current U . S .  Congress is the most evil corrupt and incompetent body ever to occupy the Capitol Building . These people all deserve to be impeached or tried for high treason .  If convicted tehy deserve to face a public firing squad . Check out the new blog  BUSHWACKERwww . blogger . com Satan has reserved a special oilsoaked corner of Hell for Bush Cheny and Rumsfeld where they can spend their eternal damnation blaming each other for destroying the Earth . Bush has not done ONE productive thing since he stole the last two elections .  However he has1 .  Massacred tens of thousands of Iraqs citizens and 2500 U . S .  soldiers2 .  Turned America into a police state where his billiondollar boondoggle Homeland Security considers everyone guilty until proven innocent3 .  Tarnished Americas reputation as a global leader and worldwide peacekeeper4 .  Contributed to the demise of the Earth through failed environmental and ecological policies5 .  Virtually eliminated the American middle class to a point where within a generation the U . S .  will be a twotiered society like Haiti and the Dominican Republic there will be the very very rich Bushs buddies and the rest of us the very very poor6 .  Put the USA trillions of dollars into debt which will take generations to pay off if it ever can7 .  Neglected the poor the sick the aged the disabled the hungry and the disadvantaged in America8 .  Greedily played Robin Hood in Reverse by taking from the poor and giving to his rich friends special interest groups lobbyists and megacorporations who in turn make generous if not illegal campaign contributions to the GOP9 .  Given every other country in the world reason to fear us and a motivation to build their own nuclear weapons with which to protect themselves from the new evil empire the USA10 .  Tortured prisoners most of whom are being held without legitimate charges and most of whom are being tortured outside of the rules of the Geneva Convention . Thomas Jefferson once said The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants .  That time is way past due .  Its time for a new American Revolution that will completely demolish the Republican and Democratic parties and eliminate the stranglehold these wicked power brokers have on American politics .  ,9

No sound or low sound ?  I have my volume turned up all the way and have the same on the video .  But I can barely hear any sound .  What can I do to get me sound back fully ?  My yahoo music is real hard to hear to .  As an old techie I tend to look at the hardware or more specifically the connections . If your connections are in an area that has gotten dusty over time clean it out with appropriate dusting measures or canned air .   Unplug your computer unplug your speakers from the computer whiz out the connector with canned air clean both ends with alcohol on a cotton swab whiz out with canned air again make sure you have a secure connection if loose tape steady in the squarelyin position and then restart the computer and see if your problem is resolved suggest you clean all other connections while youre back there . Best wishes  ,4
